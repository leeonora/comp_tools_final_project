==Names==
{{Main|Names of Istanbul}}

The first known name of the city is ''[[Byzantium]]'' ({{langx|grc|Βυζάντιον}}, {{Transliteration|grc|Byzántion}}), the name given to it at its foundation by [[Megarian]] colonists around 657 BCE.<ref name="Britannica-Istanbul">{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Istanbul|title=Istanbul|website=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]|date=3 October 2023 }}</ref><ref name="roo177">{{harvnb|Room|2006|p=177}}</ref> Megarian colonists claimed a direct line back to the founders of the city, Byzas, the son of the god Poseidon and the nymph Ceroëssa.<ref name="roo177"/> Modern excavations have raised the possibility that the name Byzantium might reflect the sites of native [[Thracian]] settlements that preceded the fully-fledged town.{{sfn|Georgacas|1947|p=352ff}} [[Constantinople]] ({{langx|el|Κωνσταντινούπολις|translit=Kōnstantinoupolis}}; {{langx|lat|Constantinopolis}}) comes from the Latin name {{langr|la|Constantinus}}, after [[Constantine the Great]], the Roman emperor who refounded the city in 324 CE.<ref name="roo177"/> Constantine had initially called the city [[New Rome]] ({{langx|grc|Νέα Ῥώμη}}; {{lang|grc-Latn|Nea Rhomē}}; {{langx|la|Nova Roma}}).<ref name="Britannica-Istanbul"/> Constantinople remained the most common name for the city in the West until the 1930s, when Turkish authorities began to press for the use of ''Istanbul'' in foreign languages. {{Transliteration|ota|Ḳosṭanṭīnīye}} ({{langx|ota|قسطنطينيه}}) and {{lang|tr|İstanbul}} were the names used alternatively by the Ottomans during their rule.{{sfn|Necipoğlu|2010|p=262}}

The name {{lang|tr|İstanbul}} ({{langx|ota|استانبول}}<nowiki>;</nowiki> {{IPA|tr|ɯsˈtambuɫ|pron}} or colloquially {{IPA|tr|isˈtanbuɫ||audio=Istanbul pronunciation.ogg}}) is commonly held to derive from the [[Medieval Greek]] phrase {{Transliteration|grc|eis tḕn [[Polis|Pólin]]}} ({{lang|grc|εἰς τὴν Πόλιν}}, {{IPA|grc|is tim ˈbolin|pron}}), literally "to the city",<ref>Necdet Sakaoğlu (1993/94a): "İstanbul'un adları" ["The names of Istanbul"]. In: ''Dünden bugüne İstanbul ansiklopedisi'', ed. Türkiye Kültür Bakanlığı, Istanbul.</ref> and is how Constantinople was referred to by the local Greeks. This reflected its status as the only major city in the vicinity. The importance of Constantinople in the Ottoman world was also reflected by its nickname {{lang|tr|Dersaadet}} ({{langx|ota|درساعدت}}) meaning the 'Gate to Prosperity' in Ottoman Turkish.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Grosvenor |first1=Edwin Augustus |title=Constantinople |date=1895 |publisher=Roberts Brothers |volume=1 |page=69 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IGoLAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA69 |access-date=15 March 2021}}</ref> An alternative view is that the name evolved directly from "Constantinople", with the first and third syllables dropped.<ref name="roo177" /> Some Ottoman sources of the 17th century, such as [[Evliya Çelebi]], describe it as the common Turkish name of the time; between the late 17th and late 18th centuries, it was also in official use. The first use of the word {{Transliteration|ota|Islambol}} ({{langx|ota|اسلامبول}}) on coinage was in 1730 during the reign of Sultan [[Mahmud I]].{{sfn|Finkel|2005|pp=57, 383}} In modern [[Turkish language|Turkish]], the name is written as {{lang|tr|İstanbul}}, with a dotted İ, as the [[Turkish alphabet]] distinguishes between a [[İ|dotted]] and [[dotless I]]. In English, the stress is on the first or last syllable, but in Turkish it is on the second syllable.{{sfn|Göksel|Kerslake|2005|p=27}} A person from the city is an {{lang|tr|İstanbullu}} (plural {{lang|tr|İstanbullular}}); ''Istanbulite'' is used in English.{{sfn|Keyder|1999|p=95}}

The vast destruction of Greek property, businesses, and churches provides evidence of the Turkish authorities’ intent to terrorize the Greeks in Istanbul into abandoning the territory, thus eliminating the Greek minority. This practice falls within the ambit of the crime of ‘‘ethnic cleansing,’’ which the UN General Assembly and the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia have interpreted as constituting a form of genocide...

The city's summers are warm to hot and moderately dry, with an average daytime temperature of about {{Convert|28|C|F}}, and less than 7 days of precipitation per month.<ref name=":3" /><ref name=":5" /> Despite the generally acceptable temperature range, mid-summer in Istanbul is considered moderately uncomfortable, due to high dew points and relative humidity.<ref name=":3">{{Cite journal |last1=Abbasnia |first1=Mohsen |last2=Toros |first2=Hüseyin |last3=Memarian |first3=Hadi |date=2019 |title=Analysis of Climate in the Megacity of Istanbul Based on Human Bioclimatic Comfort Index |url=https://avesis.itu.edu.tr/yayin/26af2d5e-0c30-4b5d-83a5-9ffe2be7a179/analysis-of-climate-in-the-megacity-of-istanbul-based-on-human-bioclimatic-comfort-index |journal=Journal of Research in Atmospheric Science |volume=1 |issue=1 |issn=0000-0000}}</ref><ref name=":5" /> Winters, meanwhile, feature daytime temperatures oscillating between {{Convert|5-10|C|F}}, with frequent, sometimes intense, precipitation.<ref name=":5" />

Istanbul's precipitation is therefore unevenly distributed, with winter months getting at least twice the level of precipitation of their summerly counterparts. Cloudiness, as with precipitation, varies greatly by season. Winters are quite cloudy, with around 20 percent of days featuring sunshine. Meanwhile, summers experience 60-70 percent of possible sunshine.

Snowfall is sporadic, but accumulates virtually every winter; and when it does, it is highly disruptive to city infrastructure.

====European side====
[[File:Historical peninsula and modern skyline of Istanbul.jpg|thumb|left|[[Fatih]] district comprises the [[Constantinople|historical peninsula]] of Istanbul]]

{{anchor|Rumeli}}<!--[[Rumeli (Istanbul)]] redirects here-->{{lang|tr|Rumeli}} ("[[Rumelia]]") is a local nickname for the European side of Istanbul. 

The [[Fatih]] district, which was named after Mehmed II ([[Turkish language|Turkish]]: ''Fatih Sultan Mehmed''), corresponds to what was the whole of Constantinople until the Ottoman conquest; today it is the capital district and called the ''historic peninsula'' of Istanbul on the southern shore of the [[Golden Horn]], across the medieval [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] citadel of [[Galata]] on the northern shore. The Genoese fortifications in Galata were largely demolished in the 19th century, leaving only the [[Galata Tower]], to make way for the northward expansion of the city.<ref>{{harvnb|Çelik|1993|pp=70, 169}}</ref> Galata ([[Karaköy]]) is today a quarter within the Beyoğlu district, which forms Istanbul's commercial and entertainment center and includes [[İstiklal Avenue]] and [[Taksim Square]].<ref>{{harvnb|Çelik|1993|p=127}}</ref>

[[File:Wooden building on the Bosphorus.jpg|thumb|Originally outside the city, ''[[yalı]]'' residences along the Bosporus are now homes in some of Istanbul's elite neighborhoods|alt=Two- and three-story colored houses with docks and balconies, built directly on the edge of the water]]

[[Dolmabahçe Palace]], the seat of government during the late Ottoman period, is in the [[Beşiktaş]] district on the European shore of the Bosporus, to the north of Beyoğlu. The former village of [[Ortaköy]] is within Beşiktaş and gives its name to the [[Ortaköy Mosque]] on the Bosporus, near the [[Bosporus Bridge]]. Lining both the European and Asian shores of the Bosporus are the historic ''[[yalı]]s'', luxurious chalet mansions built by Ottoman aristocrats and elites as summer homes.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/10/29/arts/antiques-for-turks-art-to-mark-700th-year.html |last=Moonan|first=Wendy|work=The New York Times|title=For Turks, Art to Mark 700th Year|date=29 October 1999|access-date=4 July 2012}}</ref> Inland, north of Taksim Square is the [[Istanbul Central Business District]], a set of corridors lined with office buildings, residential towers, shopping centers, and university campuses, and over {{convert|2000000|m2|abbr=on}} of class-A office space in total.

The Atatürk Airport corridor is another such [[edge city]]-style business, residential and shopping corridor with over {{convert|900000|m2|abbr=on}} of class-A office space.<ref name=property2021/>

====Asian side====
[[File:Istanbul Levent skyline.jpg|thumb|A view of [[Levent]] from [[Kanlıca]] across the Bosporus]]

During the Ottoman period, [[Üsküdar]] (then Scutari) and [[Kadıköy]] were outside the scope of the urban area, serving as tranquil outposts with seaside ''yalıs'' and gardens. But in the second half of the 20th century, the Asian side experienced major urban growth; the late development of this part of the city led to better infrastructure and tidier urban planning when compared with most other residential areas in the city.{{sfn|WCTR Society|Unʼyu Seisaku Kenkyū Kikō|2004|p=281}} Much of the Asian side of the Bosporus functions as a suburb of the economic and commercial centers in European Istanbul, accounting for a third of the city's population but only a quarter of its employment.{{sfn|WCTR Society|Unʼyu Seisaku Kenkyū Kikō|2004|p=281}} However, [[Kozyatağı]]–[[Ataşehir]], [[Altunizade]], [[Beykoz|Kavacık]] and [[Ümraniye]], all together having around 1.4 million sqm of class-A office space, are now important "[[edge cities]]", i.e. corridors and nodes of business and shopping centers and of tall residential buildings.<ref name=property2021/>

====Expansion====
As a result of Istanbul's exponential growth in the 20th century, a significant portion of the city is composed of ''[[gecekondu]]s'' (literally "built overnight"), referring to illegally constructed squatter buildings.<ref name="kar7896">{{harvnb|Karpat|1976|pp=78–96}}</ref> At present, some ''gecekondu'' areas are being gradually demolished and replaced by modern mass-housing compounds.<ref name="yavuz">{{cite news|last=Yavuz |first=Ercan |url=http://www.todayszaman.com/newsDetail_getNewsById.action?load=detay&link=177450&bolum=103 |work=Today's Zaman |title=Gov't launches plan to fight illegal construction |date=8 June 2009 |access-date=20 December 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120120204750/http://www.todayszaman.com/newsDetail_getNewsById.action?load=detay&link=177450&bolum=103 |archive-date=20 January 2012 }}</ref> Moreover, large scale [[gentrification]] and [[urban renewal]] projects have been taking place,<ref name="AtkinsonBridge2005">{{cite book|first1=Rowland|last1=Atkinson|first2=Gary|last2=Bridge|title=Gentrification in a Global Context: The New Urban Colonialism|url={{Google books|s_Z8dxsXWxQC|page=PA123|keywords=|text=|plainurl=yes}}|access-date=6 May 2013|year=2005|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-32951-4|pages=123–}}</ref> such as the one in [[Tarlabaşı]];<ref>{{cite news |title=Poor but Proud Istanbul Neighborhood Faces Gentrification |first=Jessica |last=Bourque |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/05/world/middleeast/05iht-m05-turkey-tarlabasi.html |newspaper=The New York Times |date=4 July 2012 |access-date=6 May 2013}}</ref> some of these projects, like the one in [[Sulukule]], have faced criticism.<ref>{{cite news |title=Forced gentrification plan spells end for old Roma district in Istanbul |first=Robert |last=Tait |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/jul/22/roma.turkey |newspaper=The Guardian |date=22 July 2008 |access-date=6 May 2013}}</ref> The Turkish government also has ambitious plans for an expansion of the city west and northwards on the European side in conjunction with the new [[Istanbul Airport]], opened in 2019; the new parts of the city will include four different settlements with specified urban functions, housing 1.5&nbsp;million people.<ref>{{cite news |title=New city construction to begin in six months |url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/new-city-construction-to-begin-in-six-months.aspx?nid=41622&pageID=238 |newspaper=Hurriyet Daily News |date=22 February 2013 |access-date=6 May 2013}}</ref>

===Parks===
[[File:Yildiz Park 02.jpg|thumb|[[Yıldız Park]] connects [[Yıldız Palace]] to [[Çırağan Palace]]]]

Istanbul does not have a primary urban park, but it has several green areas. [[Gülhane Park]] and [[Yıldız Park]] were originally included within the grounds of two of Istanbul's palaces — Topkapı Palace and [[Yıldız Palace]]—but they were repurposed as public parks in the early decades of the Turkish Republic.<ref>{{harvnb|Boyar|Fleet|2010|p=247}}</ref> Another park, [[Fethi Paşa Korusu]], is on a hillside adjacent to the Bosphorus Bridge in Anatolia, opposite Yıldız Palace in Europe.

Along the European side, and close to the [[Fatih Sultan Mehmet Bridge]], is [[Emirgan Park]], which was known as the ''Kyparades'' ('Cypress Forest') during the Byzantine period. In the Ottoman period, it was first granted to [[Lord Chancellor|Nişancı]] [[Feridun Ahmed Bey]] in the 16th century, before being granted by Sultan [[Murad IV]] to the [[Safavid dynasty|Safavid]] emir Gûne Han in the 17th century, hence the name ''Emirgan''. The {{convert|47|ha|acre|adj=on}} park was later owned by Khedive [[Isma'il Pasha]] of [[Khedivate of Egypt|Ottoman Egypt]] in the 19th century. Emirgan Park is known for its diversity of plants and an annual [[tulip]] festival is held there since 2005.<ref>{{harvnb|Taylor|2007|p=241}}</ref>

The [[Justice and Development Party (Turkey)|AKP]] government's decision to replace [[Taksim Gezi Park]] with a replica of the Ottoman era [[Taksim Military Barracks]] (which was transformed into the [[Taksim Stadium]] in 1921, before being demolished in 1940 for building Gezi Park) sparked a series of [[Gezi Park protests|nationwide protests in 2013]] covering a wide range of issues.

Popular during the summer among Istanbulites is [[Belgrad Forest]], spreading across {{convert|5500|ha|acre|adj=off}} at the northern edge of the city. The forest originally supplied water to the city and remnants of reservoirs used during Byzantine and Ottoman times survive.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kultur.gov.tr/EN/belge/2-14846/water-supply-systems-reservoirs-charity-and-free-founta-.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101119053754/http://www.kultur.gov.tr/EN/belge/2-14846/water-supply-systems-reservoirs-charity-and-free-founta-.html|archive-date=19 November 2010 |publisher=Republic of Turkey Ministry of Culture and Tourism|title=Water Supply Systems, Reservoirs, Charity and Free Fountains, Turkish Baths|access-date=29 April 2012}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Time Out Guides|2010|p=212}}</ref>

===Architecture===

[[File:Hagia Sophia Mars 2013.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Hagia Sophia]] was built by [[Justinian I|Justinian]] in the 6th century.|alt=A reddish building topped by a large dome and surrounded by smaller domes and four towers]]

Istanbul is primarily known for its Byzantine and Ottoman architecture, but its buildings reflect the various peoples and empires that have previously ruled the city. Examples of Genoese and Roman architecture remain visible in Istanbul alongside their Ottoman counterparts. While nothing of the [[Ancient Greek architecture|architecture of the classical Greek period]] has survived, [[Ancient Roman architecture|Roman architecture]] has proved to be more durable. Obelisks from the [[Hippodrome of Constantinople]] are still visible in Sultanahmet Square, while a section of the [[Valens Aqueduct]], constructed in the late 4th century, stands relatively intact at the western edge of the Fatih district.<ref name="coaot">{{harvnb|Chamber of Architects of Turkey|2006|pp=80, 118}}</ref> The [[Column of Constantine]], erected in 330 AD to mark the new Roman capital, still stands not far from the Hippodrome.<ref name="coaot" />

Early [[Byzantine architecture]] followed the classical Roman model of domes and arches, but improved upon these elements, as in the [[Little Hagia Sophia|Church of the Saints Sergius and Bacchus]]. The oldest surviving Byzantine church in Istanbul—albeit in ruins—is the [[Monastery of Stoudios]] (later converted into the Imrahor Mosque), which was built in 454.<ref>{{harvnb|Chamber of Architects of Turkey|2006|p=176}}</ref> After the recapture of Constantinople in 1261, the Byzantines enlarged two of the most important churches still extant, [[Chora Church]] and [[Pammakaristos Church]]. Still, the pinnacle of Byzantine architecture, and one of Istanbul's most iconic structures, is the [[Hagia Sophia]]. Topped by a dome {{convert|31|m|ft|sp=us}} in diameter,<ref>{{harvnb|Gregory|2010|p=138}}</ref> the Hagia Sophia stood as the world's largest cathedral for more than a thousand years, before being converted into a mosque and, as it stands now, a museum.<ref name="klwa171" />

Among the oldest surviving examples of [[Ottoman architecture]] in Istanbul are the [[Anadoluhisarı]] and [[Rumelihisarı]] fortresses, which assisted the Ottomans during their siege of the city.<ref>{{harvnb|Freely|2000|p=283}}</ref> Over the next four centuries, the Ottomans proceeded to make an indelible impression on the skyline of Istanbul, building towering mosques and ornate palaces. The largest palace, Topkapı, includes a diverse array of architectural styles, from [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] inside the Harem, to its [[neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]] Enderûn Library.<ref>{{harvnb|Necipoğlu|1991|pp=180, 136–137}}</ref> The [[Mosques commissioned by the Ottoman dynasty|imperial mosques]] include [[Sultan Ahmed Mosque]] (the Blue Mosque), Süleymaniye Mosque, and [[New Mosque (Istanbul)|Yeni Mosque]], all of which were built at the peak of the Ottoman Empire, in the 16th and 17th centuries. In the following centuries, and especially after the ''Tanzimat'' reforms, Ottoman architecture was supplanted by European styles.<ref>{{harvnb|Çelik|1993|p=159}}</ref> Areas around [[İstiklal Avenue]] were filled with grand European embassies and rows of buildings in Neoclassical and [[Renaissance Revival architecture|Renaissance Revival]] styles, which went on to influence the architecture of a variety of structures in Beyoğlu—including churches, stores, and theaters—and official buildings such as Dolmabahçe Palace.<ref>{{harvnb|Çelik|1993|pp=133–34, 141}}</ref>

They handle local affairs of national agencies, such as the [[General Directorate of Security (Turkey)|General Directorate of Security]]. Law enforcement in Turkey is mostly centralized, and thus Istanbul does not have a separated armed police force. [[Wali (administrative title)|''Vali'']] and their organization are responsible for coordinating public safety efforts throughout a province.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Mecek |first=Mehmet |date=2020-12-28 |title=Bir Mülki (Taşra) İdare Birimi Olarak Türkiye'de İl Yönetimleri ve Hukuki - Örgütsel Yapıları |trans-title=Provincial Administrations in Turkey as a Civil (Provincial) Administrative Unit and Their Legal – Organizational Structures |url=https://dergipark.org.tr/tr/pub/kkujebpir/issue/58780/828772 |journal=Ekonomi İşletme Siyaset ve Uluslararası İlişkiler Dergisi |language=tr |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=296–325 |issn=2149-0732}}</ref>

''[[Kaymakam]]'' is a representative of the central government in a district. Their nature of duties is similar to a ''Vali'', yet they also handle bureaucratic works regarding the central government organizations in their respective districts. For instance, ''Kaymakam'' may audit a school operated by the [[Ministry of National Education (Turkey)|Ministry of National Education]].<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Parlak |first1=Bekir |last2=Doğan |first2=Kadir Caner |date=2018-08-30 |title=Türkiye'de Mevcut İl Yönetimi Ve İlçe Yönetimi: Tarihsel Ve Yapısal Bir İnceleme |trans-title=The Current Provincial and District Administration in Turkey: A Historical and Structural Analysis |url=https://dergipark.org.tr/tr/pub/mana/issue/38967/452510 |journal=Uluslararası Yönetim Akademisi Dergisi |language=tr |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=42–52 |issn=2636-8048}}</ref>

=== Politics ===
Politically, Istanbul is seen as the most important administrative region in Turkey. In the run-up to [[2019 Turkish local elections|local elections in 2019]], Erdoğan claimed 'if we fail in Istanbul, we will fail in Turkey'.<ref>{{cite web |date=2 April 2019 |title=Erdoğan: 'İstanbul'da teklersek, Türkiye'de tökezleriz' |trans-title="Erdoğan: 'If we stumble in Istanbul, we falter in Turkey.'" |url=https://tele1.com.tr/erdogan-istanbulda-teklersek-turkiyede-tokezleriz-44258/ |access-date=4 May 2019 |website=Tele1}}</ref> The [[March 2019 Istanbul mayoral election|contest in Istanbul]] carried deep political, economic and symbolic significance for Erdoğan, whose [[1994 Istanbul mayoral election|election of mayor of Istanbul in 1994]] had served as his launchpad.<ref name="inglebylove">{{cite news |last1=Ingleby |first1=Melvyn |date=14 June 2019 |title=A Turkish Opposition Leader Is Fighting Erdoğan With 'Radical Love' |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2019/06/ex-istanbul-mayor-imamoglu-fights-erdogan-radical-love/591541/ |access-date=14 December 2020 |work=The Atlantic}}</ref> For [[Ekrem İmamoğlu]], winning the mayoralty of Istanbul was a huge moral victory, but for Erdoğan it had practical ramifications: His party, AKP, lost control of the $4.8&nbsp;billion municipal budget, which had sustained patronage at the point of delivery of many public services for 25 years.<ref name="pitel2019">{{cite news |last1=Pitel |first1=Laura |date=24 June 2019 |title=Erdoğan's defeat in Istanbul shows opposition's changing tactics |url=https://www.ft.com/content/93736230-95f9-11e9-8cfb-30c211dcd229 |access-date=14 December 2020 |newspaper=Financial Times}}</ref>[[File:Imamoglu press conference April 3, 2019.jpg|thumb|[[Ekrem İmamoğlu]] of the [[Republican People's Party]] is the 32nd and current [[Mayor of Istanbul]], [[June 2019 Istanbul mayoral election|first elected in 2019]] and [[2024 Istanbul mayoral election|re-elected in 2024]]]]

More recently, Istanbul and many of Turkey's metropolitan cities are following a trend away from the government and their right-wing ideology. In 2013 and 2014, large scale [[Gezi Park protests|anti-AKP government protests]] began in İstanbul and spread throughout the nation. This trend first became evident electorally in the [[2014 Istanbul mayoral election|2014 mayoral election]] where the center-left opposition candidate won an impressive 40% of the vote, despite not winning. The first government defeat in Istanbul occurred in the [[2017 Turkish constitutional referendum|2017 constitutional referendum]], where Istanbul voted 'No' by 51.4% to 48.6%. The AKP government had supported a 'Yes' vote and won the vote nationally due to high support in rural parts of the country. A major turning point for the government came in the 2019 local elections, where their candidate for Mayor, former Prime Minister [[Binali Yıldırım]], was defeated by a very narrow margin by the [[Republican People's Party]] candidate Ekrem İmamoğlu. İmamoğlu won the vote with 48.77% of the vote, against Yıldırım's 48.61%, but the elections were controversially annulled by the [[Supreme Electoral Council (Turkey)|Supreme Electoral Council]] due to AKP's claim of electoral fraud. In the re-run İmamoğlu gathered 54.22% of the total vote and widened his margin of victory.<ref>{{cite news |author=Isil Sariyuce and Ivana Kottasová |title=Istanbul election rerun set to be won by opposition, in blow to Erdogan |url=https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/23/europe/turkey-istanbul-mayor-election-intl/index.html |website=CNN}}</ref>

Following the 2019 election, a trend towards the CHP has persisted across the city. In the [[2023 Turkish presidential election|2023 presidential election]] the CHP candidate, [[Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu]], received 48.56% of the city's vote, while the incumbent president and AKP candidate, [[Recep Tayyip Erdoğan]], received 46.68%.

In the [[2024 Istanbul mayoral election|2024 local elections]], Ekrem İmamoğlu was re-elected by a 12-point margin. İmamoğlu won 51.15% of the vote, while the AKP's candidate [[Murat Kurum]] received 39.59%. Additionally, the CHP won the mayoralties in 26 of İstanbul's 39 districts.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Seçim 2024 |url=https://secim.aa.com.tr/ |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230514223153/https://secim.aa.com.tr// |archive-date=14 May 2023 |access-date=2024-04-04 |website=secim.aa.com.tr}}</ref>

Administratively, Istanbul is divided into 39 districts, more than any other [[provinces of Turkey|province]] in Turkey. [[Istanbul Province]] sends 98 [[Member of Parliament#Turkey|Members of Parliament]] to the Grand National Assembly of Turkey, which has a total of 600 seats. For the purpose of parliamentary elections, Istanbul is divided into [[İstanbul (electoral districts)|three electoral districts]]; two on the European side and [[İstanbul (1st electoral district)|one on the Asian side]], electing 28, 35 and 35 MPs respectively.{{citation needed|date=November 2020}}

Throughout most of its history, Istanbul has ranked among the largest cities in the world.

Istanbul is known for its historic seafood restaurants.

[[Kumkapı]] along the Sea of Marmara has a pedestrian zone that hosts around fifty fish restaurants.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/default.aspx?pageid=438&n=managing-the-difficult-balance-between-tourism-and-authenticity-kumkapi-2008-07-26|work=Hürriyet Daily News|title=Managing the Difficult Balance Between Tourism and Authenticity|last=Schäfers|first=Marlene|date=26 July 2008|access-date=29 April 2012}}</ref>

The [[Princes' Islands]], {{convert|15|km|mi|sp=us|0}} from the city center, are also popular for their seafood restaurants.

Istanbul is also famous for its sophisticated and elaborately cooked dishes of the [[Ottoman cuisine]]. Following the influx of immigrants from southeastern and eastern Turkey, which began in the 1960s, the city's foodscape has drastically changed by the end of the century; with influences of Middle Eastern cuisine such as [[kebab]] taking an important place in the food scene.

Restaurants featuring foreign cuisines are mainly concentrated in the [[Beyoğlu]], [[Beşiktaş]], [[Şişli]] and [[Kadıköy]] districts.

Apart from the city's numerous stadiums, sports halls and concert halls, there are several open-air venues for concerts and festivals, such as the [[Cemil Topuzlu Open-Air Theatre]] in [[Şişli|Harbiye]], Paraf Kuruçeşme Open-Air on the Bosphorus shore in [[Kuruçeşme]], and Parkorman in the forest of [[Maslak]]. The annual [[Istanbul Jazz Festival]] has been held every year since 1994. Organized between 2003 and 2013, [[Rock'n Coke]] was the biggest open-air rock festival in Turkey, sponsored by Coca-Cola. It was traditionally held at the [[Hezarfen Airfield]] in Istanbul.

The [[Istanbul International Music Festival]] has been held annually since 1973, and the [[International Istanbul Film Festival]] has been held annually since 1982. The [[Istanbul Biennial]] is a contemporary art exhibition that has been held biennially since 1987. The [[Istanbul Shopping Fest]] is an annual shopping festival held since 2011, and [[Teknofest]] is an annual festival of aviation, aerospace and technology, held since 2018.

When it was held for the first time in 2003, the annual [[Istanbul Pride]] became the first gay pride event in a Muslim-majority country.<ref>{{cite web|title=Turkey's LGBT community draws hope from Harvey Milk|url=https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2013/12/turkey-lgbt-discrimination-legal-protection-public-awareness.html|access-date=27 January 2022|website=Al Monitor|date=17 June 2016}}</ref> Since 2015, all types of parades at [[Taksim Square]] and [[İstiklal Avenue]] (where, in 2013, the [[Gezi Park protests]] took place) have been denied permission by the [[Justice and Development Party (Turkey)|AKP]] government, citing security concerns, but hundreds of people have defied the ban each year.
