==Etymology==
{{lang|goh|Frankonovurd}} (in [[Old High German]]) or {{lang|la|Vadum Francorum}} (in [[Latin]]) were the first names mentioned in written records from 794. It transformed to ''Frankenfort'' during the [[Middle Ages]] and then to ''Franckfort'' and ''Franckfurth'' in the [[modern history|modern era]]. The name is derived from the ''Franconofurd'' of the [[Germanic peoples|Germanic tribe]] of the [[Franks]]; ''Furt'' ([[cf.]] English ''[[ford (river)|ford]]'') where the river was shallow enough to be crossed on foot.
[[File:Die Frankenfurt.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|"The Discovery of Frankfurt by Charlemagne" by [[Leopold Bode]] (1888)]]

[[Thietmar of Merseburg]] in the 11th century reported a [[founding myth|founding legend]] in which Charlemagne and his army of Franks discovered the ford at Frankfurt when a [[deer|doe]] crossed over it, showing them the way; in honor of this the city was named "ford of the Franks".

By the 19th century, the name ''Frankfurt'' had been established as the official spelling. The older English spelling of ''Frankfort'' is now rarely seen in reference to Frankfurt am Main, although more than a dozen other towns and cities, mainly in the United States, use this spelling, including [[Frankfort, Kentucky]], [[Frankfort (town), New York|Frankfort, New York]], and [[Frankfort, Illinois]]. ''The New York Times'' first used the Frankfurt spelling for Frankfurt am Main on 24 October 1953 and last used the Frankfort spelling on 10 June 1954.

The suffix ''am Main'' has been used regularly since the 14th century. In English, the city's full name of ''Frankfurt am Main'' means "Frankfurt on the Main" (pronounced like English ''mine'' or German {{lang|de|mein}}). Frankfurt is located on an ancient ford (German: ''{{Lang|de|Furt}}'') on the river [[Main (river)|Main]]. As a part of early [[Franconia]], the inhabitants were the early [[Franks]], thus the city's name reveals its legacy as "the ford of the Franks on the Main".<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M1JIPAN-eJ4C&pg=PA135 |title=Placenames of the world |last=Room |first=Adrian |publisher=McFarland |year=2006 |page=135 |access-date=23 July 2009 |isbn=978-0-7864-2248-7 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722025846/http://books.google.com/books?id=M1JIPAN-eJ4C&lpg=PA135&pg=PA135 |archive-date=22 July 2011 |url-status=live}}</ref>

Among English speakers, the city is commonly known simply as Frankfurt, but Germans occasionally call it by its full name to distinguish it from the other (significantly smaller) German city of [[Frankfurt (Oder)|Frankfurt an der Oder]] in the [[States of Germany|''Land'']] of [[Brandenburg]] on the Polish border.

The city district [[Bonames]] has a name probably dating back to Roman times, thought to be derived from ''{{Not a typo|bona me(n)sa}}'' (good table).

The common abbreviations for the city, primarily used in railway services and on road signs, are ''Frankfurt (Main)'', ''Frankfurt (M)'', ''Frankfurt a. M.'', ''Frankfurt/Main'' or ''Frankfurt/M''. The common [[abbreviation]] for the name of the city is "FFM". Also in use is "FRA", the [[International Air Transport Association airport code|IATA code]] for Frankfurt Airport.

===Early history and Holy Roman Empire===
At the western borders of Frankfurt lies the [[Michelsberg culture#Settlements|Kapellenberg]] as part of the Taunus with one of the first Stone Age cities in Europe.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.leiza.de/en/research/project-4/the-onset-of-urbanisation-in-the-rhine-main-region-6000-years-ago | title=LEIZA: The onset of urbanisation in the Rhine-Main region 6,000 years ago | access-date=17 December 2023 | archive-date=13 March 2024 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240313223529/https://www.leiza.de/en/research/project-4/the-onset-of-urbanisation-in-the-rhine-main-region-6000-years-ago | url-status=live }}</ref> The Celts had different settlements in the Taunus mountains north of Frankfurt, the biggest one the [[Heidetrank Oppidum]]. The first traces of [[Germania|Roman settlements]] established in the area of the [[Nidda River|river Nidda]] date to the reign of Emperor [[Vespasian]] in the years 69 to 79 AD. [[Nida (Roman town)|Nida]] (modern [[Heddernheim]], [[Praunheim]]) was a Roman [[civitas]] capital (''Civitas Taunensium'').

[[Alemanni]] and Franks [[Francia|lived there]], and by 794, [[Charlemagne]] presided over an [[Council of Frankfurt|imperial assembly]] and church synod, at which ''Franconofurd'' (alternative spellings end with -furt and -{{Not a typo|vurd}}) was first mentioned. It was one of the two capitals of Charlemagne's grandson [[Louis the German]], together with [[Regensburg]]. Louis founded the [[collegiate church]], rededicated in 1239 to [[Bartholomew the Apostle]] and now [[Frankfurt Cathedral]].<ref>{{cite book |author=Rolf Grosse |title=Du royaume franc aux origines de la France et de l'Allemagne 800–1214 |publisher=Presses Universitaires du Septentrion |date=2014 |page=47}}</ref>

Frankfurt was one of the most important cities in the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. From 855, the [[German kings]] were elected and crowned in [[Aachen]]. From 1562, the kings and [[Coronation of the Holy Roman Emperor|emperors were crowned]] and [[Imperial election|elected]] in Frankfurt, initiated for [[Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian II]]. This tradition ended in 1792, when [[Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis II]] was elected. His coronation was deliberately held on [[Bastille Day]], 14 July, the anniversary of the [[storming of the Bastille]]. The elections and coronations took place in [[Frankfurt Cathedral|St. Bartholomäus Cathedral]], known as the {{lang|de|Kaiserdom}} (Emperor's Cathedral), or its predecessors.

The {{lang|de|[[Messe Frankfurt|Frankfurter Messe]]}} ('Frankfurt Trade Fair') was first mentioned in 1150. In 1240, [[Emperor Frederick II]] granted an imperial privilege to its visitors, meaning they would be protected by the empire. The fair became particularly important when similar fairs in French Beaucaire lost attraction around 1380. [[Frankfurt Book Fair|Book trade fairs]] began in 1478.

In 1372, Frankfurt became a {{lang|de|Reichsstadt}} ([[Imperial Free City]]), i.e., directly subordinate to the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] and not to a regional ruler or a local nobleman.

In 1585, Frankfurt traders established a system of [[exchange rate]]s for the various currencies that were circulating to prevent cheating and extortion. Therein lay the early roots for the Frankfurt Stock Exchange.

Frankfurt managed to remain neutral during the [[Thirty Years' War]], but suffered from the [[bubonic plague]] that refugees brought to the city. After the war, Frankfurt regained its wealth. In the late 1770s the theater principal [[Abel Seyler]] was based in Frankfurt, and established the city's theatrical life.<ref>{{cite book |last=Mohr |first=Albert Richard |author-link=Albert Richard Mohr |year=1967 |chapter=Abel Seyler und seine Verdienste um das Frankfurter Theaterleben |title=Frankfurter Theater von der Wandertruppe zum Komödienhaus: ein Beitrag zur Theatergeschichte des 18.

===Impact of French revolution and the Napoleonic Wars===
Following the [[French Revolution]], Frankfurt was occupied or bombarded several times by French troops. It remained a [[Free imperial city|Free city]] until the collapse of the Holy Roman Empire in 1805/6. In 1806, it became part of the [[principality of Aschaffenburg]] under the {{lang|de|Fürstprimas}} ([[Prince-Primate]]), [[Karl Theodor Anton Maria von Dalberg]]. This meant that Frankfurt was incorporated into the [[Confederation of the Rhine]]. In 1810, Dalberg adopted the title of a [[Grand Duchy of Frankfurt|Grand Duke of Frankfurt]]. [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] intended to make his adopted son [[Eugène de Beauharnais]], already {{lang|fr|Prince de Venise}} ("[[prince of Venice]]", a newly established primogeniture in Italy), Grand Duke of Frankfurt after Dalberg's death (since the latter as a Catholic bishop had no legitimate heirs). The Grand Duchy remained a short episode lasting from 1810 to 1813 when the military tide turned in favor of the Anglo-Prussian-led allies that overturned the Napoleonic order. Dalberg abdicated in favor of Eugène de Beauharnais, which of course was only a symbolic action, as the latter effectively never ruled after the ruin of the French armies and Frankfurt's takeover by the allies.

===Frankfurt as a fully sovereign state===
After Napoleon's final defeat and abdication, the [[Congress of Vienna]] (1814–1815) dissolved the grand-duchy and Frankfurt became a fully sovereign city-state with a republican form of government. Frankfurt entered the newly founded [[German Confederation]] (till 1866) as a free city, becoming the seat of its {{lang|de|Bundestag}}, the confederal parliament where the nominally presiding [[Habsburg monarchy|Habsburg Emperor of Austria]] was represented by an Austrian "presidential envoy".

After the ill-fated [[German revolutions of 1848–1849|revolution of 1848]], Frankfurt was the seat of the first democratically elected German parliament, the [[Frankfurt Parliament]], which met in the {{lang|de|[[Frankfurter Paulskirche]]}} (St. Paul's Church) and was opened on 18 May 1848. In the year of its existence, the assembly developed a common constitution for a unified Germany, with the Prussian king as its monarch. The institution failed in 1849 when the [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]] king, [[Frederick William IV of Prussia|Frederick William IV]], declared that he would not accept "a crown from the gutter".

===Frankfurt after the loss of sovereignty===
[[File:Courbet Frankfurt.jpg|thumb|''View of Frankfurt am Main'', including the [[Alte Brücke (Frankfurt)|Alte Brücke]] (Old Bridge), by [[Gustave Courbet]] (1858)]]
Frankfurt lost its independence following the [[Austro-Prussian War]] of 1866, when Prussia annexed several smaller states, including the [[Free City of Frankfurt]]. The city was subsequently incorporated into the Prussian province of [[Hesse-Nassau]]. The occupation and annexation were widely regarded in Frankfurt as a grave injustice, yet the city retained its distinctly Western European, urban, and cosmopolitan character. The formerly independent towns of [[Bornheim (Frankfurt am Main)|Bornheim]] and [[Bockenheim (Frankfurt am Main)|Bockenheim]] were incorporated in 1890.

In 1914, the citizens founded the University of Frankfurt, later named [[Goethe University Frankfurt]]. This marked the only civic foundation of a university in Germany; today it is one of Germany's largest.

From 6 April to 17 May 1920, following military intervention to put down the [[Ruhr uprising]], [[French occupation of Frankfurt|Frankfurt was occupied by French troops]].<ref>[http://www.stadtgeschichte-ffm.de/service/chronik/chronik_5_2_e.html Chronology: Emergence of a Modern City 1866–1945] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719085810/http://www.stadtgeschichte-ffm.de/service/chronik/chronik_5_2_e.html |date=19 July 2011 }}.

Frankfurt was severely [[Bombing of Frankfurt am Main in World War II|bombed in World War II]] (1939–1945). About 5,500 residents were killed during the raids, and the once-famous [[Altstadt (Frankfurt am Main)|medieval city center]], by that time one of the largest in Germany, was almost completely destroyed. It became a [[Battle of Frankfurt|ground battlefield]] on 26 March 1945, when the Allied advance into Germany was forced to take the city in contested urban combat that included a river assault. The [[5th Infantry Division (United States)|5th Infantry Division]] and the [[6th Armored Division (United States)|6th Armored Division]] of the [[United States Army]] captured Frankfurt after several days of intense fighting, and it was declared largely secure on 29 March 1945.<ref>{{Cite book |title=World War II Order of Battle: An Encyclopedic Reference to U.S. Army Ground Forces from Battalion through Division, 1939–1946 |last=Stanton |first=Shelby |edition=2nd |year=2006 |publisher=Stackpole Books |isbn=9780811701570 |pages=57, 84}}</ref> In spite of the wartime destruction, over 40% of Frankfurt's buildings still date from before the Second World War.<ref name="zensus2011.de">{{Cite web |url=https://zensus2011.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/DE/Publikationen/Aufsaetze_Archiv/2015_12_NI_GWZ_endgueltig.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&v=4 |title=Gebäude- und Wohnungsbestand in Deutschland |publisher=Statistische Ämter des Bundes und der Länder |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240329165923/https://zensus2011.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/DE/Publikationen/Aufsaetze_Archiv/2015_12_NI_GWZ_endgueltig.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&v=4 |archive-date=29 March 2024}}</ref>

After the end of the war, Frankfurt became a part of the newly founded state of Hesse, consisting of the old [[People's State of Hesse|Hesse-(Darmstadt)]] and the [[Province of Kurhessen|Prussian Hesse]] provinces. The city was part of the [[Allied Occupation Zones in Germany#American Zone of Occupation|American Zone of Occupation]] of Germany. The Military Governor for the United States Zone (1945–1949) and the United States High Commissioner for Germany (HICOG) (1949–1952) had their headquarters in the [[IG Farben Building]], intentionally left undamaged by the Allies' wartime bombardment.

Frankfurt was the original choice for the provisional capital city of the newly founded state of [[West Germany]] in 1949. The city constructed a parliament building that was never used for its intended purpose (it housed the radio studios of [[Hessischer Rundfunk]]). In the end, [[Konrad Adenauer]], the first postwar [[Chancellor of Germany (Federal Republic)|Chancellor]], preferred the town of [[Bonn]], for the most part because it was close to his hometown, but also because many other prominent politicians opposed the choice of Frankfurt out of concern that Frankfurt would be accepted as the permanent capital, thereby weakening the West German population's support for a [[German reunification|reunification]] with [[East Germany]] and the eventual return of the capital to [[Berlin]].

Postwar reconstruction took place in a sometimes simple modern style, thus changing Frankfurt's architectural face. A few landmark buildings were reconstructed historically, albeit in a simplified manner (e.g., [[Römer]], [[St. Paul's Church, Frankfurt am Main|St. Paul's Church]], and [[Goethe House]]). The collection of historically significant [[Cairo Genizah]] documents of the Municipal Library was destroyed by the bombing. According to [[Arabist]] and Genizah scholar [[S.D. Goitein]], "not even handlists indicating its contents have survived."<ref>Goitein, S.D. ''A Mediterranean Society: The Jewish Communities of the Arab World as Portrayed in the Documents of the Cairo Geniza, Vol. I – Economic Foundations''.

The end of the war marked Frankfurt's comeback as Germany's leading financial hub, mainly because Berlin, now a city divided into [[History of Berlin#The divided city|four sectors]], could no longer rival it. In 1948, the Allies founded the [[Bank deutscher Länder]], the forerunner of {{lang|de|[[Deutsche Bundesbank]]|italic=no}}. Following this decision, more financial institutions were re-established, e.g. {{lang|de|[[Deutsche Bank]]|italic=no}} and [[Dresdner Bank]]. In the 1950s, Frankfurt Stock Exchange regained its position as the country's leading stock exchange.

Frankfurt also reemerged as Germany's transportation hub and [[Frankfurt Airport]] became Europe's second-busiest airport behind [[London Heathrow Airport]] in 1961.

During the 1970s, the city created one of Europe's most efficient underground transportation systems.<ref>{{cite web |title=Port of Frankfurt |url=http://www.worldportsource.com/ports/review/DEU_Port_of_Frankfurt_2769.php |website=World Port Source |access-date=29 March 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180329121635/http://www.worldportsource.com/ports/review/DEU_Port_of_Frankfurt_2769.php |archive-date=29 March 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref> That system includes a suburban rail system ([[Frankfurt S-Bahn|S-Bahn]]) linking outlying communities with the city center, and a deep underground light rail system with smaller coaches ([[Frankfurt U-Bahn|U-Bahn]]) also capable of travelling above ground on rails.

In 1998, the [[European Central Bank]] was founded in Frankfurt, followed by the [[European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority]] and [[European Systemic Risk Board]] in 2011.

Frankfurt is the largest city in the [[states of Germany|state]] of [[Hesse]] in the western part of Germany.

===Site===
Frankfurt is located on both sides of the river [[Main (river)|Main]], south-east of the [[Taunus]] mountain range. The southern part of the city contains the [[Frankfurt City Forest]], Germany's largest city forest. The city area is {{cvt|248.31|km²|2}} and extends over {{cvt|23.4|km|2}} east to west and {{cvt|23.3|km|2}} north to south. Its downtown is north of the river Main in [[Altstadt (Frankfurt am Main)|Altstadt]] district (the historical center) and the surrounding [[Innenstadt (Frankfurt am Main)|Innenstadt]] district. The geographical center is in [[Bockenheim (Frankfurt am Main)|Bockenheim]] district near [[Frankfurt West station]].

Frankfurt at the heart of the densely populated [[Frankfurt Rhine-Main|Frankfurt Rhine-Main Metropolitan Region]] with a population of 5.5&nbsp;million. Other important cities in the region are [[Wiesbaden]] (capital of [[Hesse]]), [[Mainz]] (capital of [[Rhineland-Palatinate]]), [[Darmstadt]], [[Offenbach am Main]], [[Hanau]], [[Aschaffenburg]], [[Bad Homburg vor der Höhe]], [[Rüsselsheim]], [[Wetzlar]] and [[Marburg]].

===Districts===
[[File:Frankfurt Subdivisions boroughs.svg|thumb|The 46 ''Stadtteile'' (city districts) of central Frankfurt, 2010]]
The city is divided into 46 city districts (''Stadtteile''), which are in turn divided into 121 city boroughs (''Stadtbezirke'') and 448 electoral districts (''Wahlbezirke''). The 46 city districts combine into 16 area districts (''[[Ortsbezirk (Frankfurt am Main)|Ortsbezirke]]''), which each have a district committee and chairperson.

The largest city district by population and area is [[Sachsenhausen (Frankfurt am Main)|Sachsenhausen]], while the smallest is [[Altstadt (Frankfurt am Main)|Altstadt]], Frankfurt's historical center. Three larger city districts (Sachsenhausen, [[Westend (Frankfurt am Main)|Westend]] and [[Nordend (Frankfurt am Main)|Nordend]]) are divided for administrative purposes into a northern (''-Nord'') and a southern (''-Süd'') part, respectively a western (''-West'') and an eastern (''-Ost'') part, but are generally considered as one city district (which is why often only 43 city districts are mentioned, even on the city's official website).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://frankfurt.de/frankfurt-entdecken-und-erleben/stadtportrait/stadtteile |title=Stadtteile |publisher=Frankfurt.de |access-date=27 September 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111014170007/http://frankfurt.de/sixcms/detail.php?id=2835 |archive-date=14 October 2011 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

Some larger housing areas are often falsely called city districts, even by locals, like Nordweststadt (part of [[Niederursel (Frankfurt am Main)|Niederursel]], [[Heddernheim (Frankfurt am Main)|Heddernheim]] and [[Praunheim (Frankfurt am Main)|Praunheim]]), Goldstein (part of [[Schwanheim (Frankfurt am Main)|Schwanheim]]), Riedberg (part of [[Kalbach-Riedberg (Frankfurt am Main)|Kalbach-Riedberg]]) and [[Europaviertel]] (part of [[Gallus (Frankfurt am Main)|Gallus]]). The [[Bankenviertel]] (''banking district''), Frankfurt's financial district, is also not an administrative city district (it covers parts of the western [[Innenstadt (Frankfurt am Main)|Innenstadt]] district, the southern [[Westend (Frankfurt am Main)|Westend]] district and the eastern [[Bahnhofsviertel (Frankfurt am Main)|Bahnhofsviertel]] district).

Many city districts are incorporated suburbs (''[[Vororte]]'') or were previously independent cities, such as [[Höchst (Frankfurt am Main)|Höchst]]. Some like [[Nordend (Frankfurt am Main)|Nordend]] and [[Westend (Frankfurt am Main)|Westend]] arose during the rapid growth of the city in the [[Gründerzeit]] following the [[Unification of Germany]], while others were formed from territory which previously belonged to other city {{Not a typo|district(s)}}, such as [[Dornbusch (Frankfurt am Main)|Dornbusch]] and [[Riederwald (Frankfurt am Main)|Riederwald]].

===History of incorporations===
Until the year 1877 the city's territory consisted of the present-day inner-city districts of [[Altstadt (Frankfurt am Main)|Altstadt]], [[Innenstadt (Frankfurt am Main)|Innenstadt]], [[Bahnhofsviertel (Frankfurt am Main)|Bahnhofsviertel]], [[Gutleutviertel (Frankfurt am Main)|Gutleutviertel]], [[Gallus (Frankfurt am Main)|Gallus]], [[Westend (Frankfurt am Main)|Westend]], [[Nordend (Frankfurt am Main)|Nordend]], [[Ostend (Frankfurt am Main)|Ostend]] and [[Sachsenhausen (Frankfurt am Main)|Sachsenhausen]].

[[Bornheim (Frankfurt am Main)|Bornheim]] was part of an administrative district called ''Landkreis Frankfurt'', before becoming part of the city on 1 January 1877, followed by [[Bockenheim (Frankfurt am Main)|Bockenheim]] on 1 April 1895. [[Seckbach (Frankfurt am Main)|Seckbach]], [[Niederrad (Frankfurt am Main)|Niederrad]] and [[Oberrad (Frankfurt am Main)|Oberrad]] followed on 1 July 1900. The ''Landkreis Frankfurt'' was finally dispersed on 1 April 1910, and therefore [[Berkersheim (Frankfurt am Main)|Berkersheim]], [[Bonames (Frankfurt am Main)|Bonames]], [[Eckenheim (Frankfurt am Main)|Eckenheim]], [[Eschersheim (Frankfurt am Main)|Eschersheim]], [[Ginnheim (Frankfurt am Main)|Ginnheim]], [[Hausen (Frankfurt am Main)|Hausen]], [[Heddernheim (Frankfurt am Main)|Heddernheim]], [[Niederursel (Frankfurt am Main)|Niederursel]], [[Praunheim (Frankfurt am Main)|Praunheim]], [[Preungesheim (Frankfurt am Main)|Preungesheim]] and [[Rödelheim (Frankfurt am Main)|Rödelheim]] joined the city. In the same year a new city district, [[Riederwald (Frankfurt am Main)|Riederwald]], was created on territory that had formerly belonged to Seckbach and Ostend.

On 1 April 1928 the City of [[Höchst (Frankfurt am Main)|Höchst]] became part of Frankfurt, as well as its city districts [[Sindlingen (Frankfurt am Main)|Sindlingen]], [[Unterliederbach (Frankfurt am Main)|Unterliederbach]] and [[Zeilsheim (Frankfurt am Main)|Zeilsheim]]. Simultaneously the ''Landkreis Höchst'' was dispersed with its member cities either joining Frankfurt ([[Fechenheim (Frankfurt am Main)|Fechenheim]], [[Griesheim (Frankfurt am Main)|Griesheim]], [[Nied (Frankfurt am Main)|Nied]], [[Schwanheim (Frankfurt am Main)|Schwanheim]], [[Sossenheim (Frankfurt am Main)|Sossenheim]]) or joining the newly established ''Landkreis'' of [[Main-Taunus-Kreis]].

[[Dornbusch (Frankfurt am Main)|Dornbusch]] became a city district in 1946. It was created on territory that had formerly belonged to Eckenheim and Ginnheim.

On 1 August 1972, Hesse's smaller suburbs of [[Harheim (Frankfurt am Main)|Harheim]], [[Kalbach (Frankfurt am Main)|Kalbach]], [[Nieder-Erlenbach (Frankfurt am Main)|Nieder-Erlenbach]], and [[Nieder-Eschbach (Frankfurt am Main)|Nieder-Eschbach]] became districts while other neighboring suburbs chose to join the Main-Taunus-Kreis, the [[Landkreis Offenbach]], the [[Kreis Groß-Gerau]], the [[Hochtaunuskreis]], the [[Main-Kinzig-Kreis]] or the [[Wetteraukreis]].

[[Bergen-Enkheim (Frankfurt am Main)|Bergen-Enkheim]] was the last suburb to become part of Frankfurt on 1 January 1977.

[[Flughafen (Frankfurt am Main)|Flughafen]] became an official city district in 1979. It covers the area of Frankfurt Airport that had belonged to Sachsenhausen and the neighboring city of [[Mörfelden-Walldorf]].

Frankfurt's youngest city district is [[Frankfurter Berg]]. It was part of Bonames until 1996.

Kalbach was officially renamed [[Kalbach-Riedberg]] in 2006 because of the large residential housing development in the area known as Riedberg.

===Neighboring districts and cities===
[[File:Locator map of Planungsverband Ballungsraum Frankfurt Rhein-Main in Hesse.svg|thumb|upright=0.8|Frankfurt urban area within [[Hesse]]]]

To the west Frankfurt borders the [[Districts of Germany|administrative district]] (''[[List of rural districts of Germany|Landkreis]]'') of [[Main-Taunus-Kreis]] with towns such as [[Hattersheim am Main]], [[Kriftel]], [[Hofheim am Taunus]], [[Kelkheim (Taunus)|Kelkheim]], [[Liederbach am Taunus]], [[Sulzbach (Taunus)|Sulzbach]], [[Schwalbach am Taunus]] and [[Eschborn]]; to the northwest the [[Hochtaunuskreis]] with [[Steinbach (Taunus)|Steinbach]], [[Oberursel (Taunus)]] and [[Bad Homburg vor der Höhe]]; to the north the [[Wetteraukreis]] with [[Karben]] and [[Bad Vilbel]]; to the northeast the [[Main-Kinzig-Kreis]] with [[Niederdorfelden]] and [[Maintal]]; to the southeast the city of [[Offenbach am Main]]; to the south the [[Offenbach (district)|Kreis Offenbach]] with [[Neu-Isenburg]] and to the southwest the [[Groß-Gerau (district)|Kreis Groß-Gerau]] with [[Mörfelden-Walldorf]], [[Rüsselsheim]] and [[Kelsterbach]].

Together with these towns (and some larger nearby towns, e.g., [[Hanau]], [[Rodgau]], [[Dreieich]], [[Langen, Hesse|Langen]]) Frankfurt forms a contiguous built-up urban area called ''Stadtregion Frankfurt'' which is not an official administrative district. The urban area had an estimated population of 2.3&nbsp;million in 2010, and is the [[List of urban areas in the European Union|13th-largest urban area in the EU]].

===Climate===
Frankfurt has a [[Temperateness|temperate]] [[oceanic climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''Cfb'', [[Trewartha climate classification|Trewartha]]: ''Dobk''). Its climate features cool winters with frequent rain showers and overcast skies, and warm summers. The average annual temperature is {{cvt|11.4|°C|1}}, with monthly mean temperatures ranging from {{cvt|2.7|°C|1}} in January to {{cvt|20.8|°C|1}} in July. The city is one of the warmest in [[Germany]] in winter.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://en.climate-data.org/europe/germany/hesse/frankfurt-am-main-447|title=Data and graphs for weather & climate in Frankfurt am Main|website=Climate-Data.org|access-date=2025-03-18}}</ref>

The [[growing season]] is longer when compared to the rest of Germany, thus resulting in an early arrival of springtime in the region, with trees typically leafing out already toward the end of March.

Winters in Frankfurt are generally mild or at least not freezing with a small possibility of snow, especially in January and February but dark and often overcast. Frankfurt is, on average, covered with snow only for around 10 to 20 days per year.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.sueddeutsche.de/wissen/schneevergleich-fuer-deutsche-staedte-so-viel-schneit-es-bei-ihnen-1.4348735 |title=Winter-Bilanz: Schnee-Vergleich für Deutsche Städte. |newspaper=Süddeutsche.de |date=28 February 2019 |publisher=sueddeutsche.de |access-date=18 January 2021 |last1=Zajonz |first1=Moritz |archive-date=19 August 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240819053700/https://www.sueddeutsche.de/wissen/schneevergleich-fuer-deutsche-staedte-so-viel-schneit-es-bei-ihnen-1.4348735 |url-status=live }}</ref> The temperature falls below 0&nbsp;°C on about 64 days and the daily maximum stays below freezing for about 10 days on average per year.

Because of the mild climate in the region, there are some well-known wine regions in the vicinity such as [[Rhenish Hesse]], [[Rheingau]], [[Franconia (wine region)]] and [[Bergstraße (route)]]. There is also a microclimate on the northern bank of the river [[Main (river)|Main]] which allows [[Palm tree|palms]], [[fig trees]], [[lemon trees]] and southern European plants to grow in that area. The area is called the "[[Nizza, Frankfurt|Nizza]]" (the German word for the southern French town [[Nice]]) and is one of the biggest parks with Mediterranean vegetation north of the [[Alps]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://frankfurt.de/english/discover-and-experience/sightseeing/gardens/nizza |title=Nizza, Stadt Frankfurt am Main |work=City of Frankfurt am Main |publisher=frankfurt.de |access-date=18 January 2021 |archive-date=18 January 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210118202137/https://frankfurt.de/english/sightseeing/gardens/nizza}}</ref>

Central Frankfurt has been a ''[[Großstadt]]'' (a city with at least 100,000 residents by definition) since 1875. With 414,576 residents in 1910, it was the ninth largest city in Germany and the number of inhabitants grew to 553,464 before [[World War II]]. After the war, at the end of the year 1945, the number had dropped to 358,000. In the following years, the population grew again and reached an all-time-high of 691,257 in 1963. It dropped again to 592,411 in 1986 but has increased since then. According to the demographic forecasts for central Frankfurt, the city will have a population up to 813,000 within its administrative boundaries in 2035<ref>{{Cite web |title=Prognose: Frankfurt gewinnt weiter viele Einwohner |url=https://www.zeit.de/zustimmung?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.zeit.de%2Fnews%2F2020-11%2F20%2Fprognose-frankfurt-gewinnt-weiter-viele-einwohner |access-date=3 May 2021 |website=ZEIT Online |archive-date=20 November 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201120121538/https://www.zeit.de/zustimmung?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.zeit.de%2Fnews%2F2020-11%2F20%2Fprognose-frankfurt-gewinnt-weiter-viele-einwohner |url-status=live }}</ref> and more than 2.5 million inhabitants in its urban area.

As of 2015, Frankfurt had 1909 [[ultra high-net-worth individual]]s, the sixth-highest number of any city in the world.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Florida |first=Richard |date=10 March 2015 |title=Mapping the Global Super-Rich |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-10/maps-of-where-the-global-super-rich-live |url-status=live |access-date=22 January 2022 |website=www.bloomberg.com |archive-date=22 January 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220122193119/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-10/maps-of-where-the-global-super-rich-live }}</ref>

During the 1970s, the state government of [[Hesse]] wanted to expand the city's administrative boundaries to include the entire urban area. This would have made Frankfurt officially the second-largest city in Germany after Berlin with up to 3 million inhabitants.<ref>H. Voit, Die kommunale Gebietsreform in: Erwin Stein (Hrsg.): 30 Jahre Hessische Verfassung, Wiesbaden 1976, p. 416 ff. (Text in German)</ref> However, because local authorities did not agree, the administrative territory is still much smaller than its actual urban area.

===Moroccan community===
Frankfurt has the largest Moroccan community in Germany, numbering about 8,000 people, and the [[Frankfurt Rhine-Main|Rhine-Main area]] has about 20,000. Many [[Moroccans]] came as guest workers in the 1970s.

=== Landtag election ===
For elections to the [[Landtag of Hesse|Hesse State Parliament]], Frankfurt am Main is split up into six constituencies. In total 15 delegates represent the city in the [[Landtag]] in [[Wiesbaden]]. The last election took place in October 2018. Six members of parliament were directly elected in their respective constituencies: Uwe Serke (CDU, Frankfurt am Main I), [[Miriam Dahlke]] (Greens, Frankfurt am Main II), Ralf-Norbert Bartel (CDU, Frankfurt am Main III), [[Michael Boddenberg]] (CDU, Frankfurt am Main IV), Markus Bocklet (Greens, Frankfurt am Main V) and Boris Rhein (CDU, Frankfurt am Main VI).

Delegates from Frankfurt often serve high-ranking positions in Hessian politics, e.g. [[Michael Boddenberg]] is Hessian Minister of Finance and Boris Rhein was elected President of the Landtag of Hesse in 2019.

=== German federal election ===
For federal elections which are held every four years, Frankfurt is split up into two constituencies. In the [[2017 German federal election|German federal election 2017]], [[Matthias Zimmer]] (CDU) and [[Bettina Wiesmann]] were elected to the Bundestag by directe mandate in [[Frankfurt am Main I (electoral district)|Frankfurt am Main I]] and [[Frankfurt am Main II (electoral district)|Frankfurt am Main II]] respectively. [[Nicola Beer]] (FDP), [[Achim Kessler]] (Linke), [[Ulli Nissen]] (SPD) and [[Omid Nouripour]] (Greens) were elected as well.

Nicola Beer resigned as a member of parliament in 2019 following her [[2019 European Parliament election|election to the European Parliament]] where she now serves as vice president.

The city's importance as a financial hub has risen since the [[eurozone crisis]]. Indications are the establishment of two institutions of the [[European System of Financial Supervisors]] ([[European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority]] and [[European Systemic Risk Board]]) in 2011, and the entry into force in 2014 of [[European Banking Supervision]], by which the European Central Bank has become the central supervisory authority for the euro area banking sector.

According to an annual study by [[Cushman & Wakefield]], the European Cities Monitor (2010), Frankfurt has been one of the top three cities for international companies in Europe, after London and Paris, since the survey started in 1990.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cushwake.com/sites/landing/citiesmonitor/European-cities-monitor-2009-holding.pdf |title=ECM 2009v1:V1 |access-date=5 October 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110922030005/http://www.cushwake.com/sites/landing/citiesmonitor/European-cities-monitor-2009-holding.pdf |archive-date=22 September 2011 |url-status=live}}</ref> It is the only German city considered to be an [[Global city#GaWC study|alpha world city (category 3)]] as listed by the [[Loughborough University]] group's 2010 inventory,<ref name="Beaverstock">{{cite web |url=http://www.lboro.ac.uk/gawc/world2010t.html |title=The World According to GaWC 2010 |publisher=Globalization and World Cities |first1=J.V. |last1=Beaverstock |first2=R.G. |last2=Smith |first3=P.J. |last3=Taylor |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131010004859/http://www.lboro.ac.uk/gawc/world2010t.html |archive-date=10 October 2013}}</ref> which was a promotion from the group's 2008 inventory when it was ranked as an alpha minus world city (category 4).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lboro.ac.uk/gawc/world2008t.html |title=GaWC 2008 |publisher=Lboro.ac.uk |date=13 April 2010 |access-date=17 February 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200117133459/https://www.lboro.ac.uk/gawc/world2008t.html |archive-date=17 January 2020 |url-status=live}}</ref>

From 1998 the ECB Headquarters have been located in Frankfurt, first in the [[Eurotower (Frankfurt)|Eurotower]] at Willy-Brandt-Platz and in two other nearby high-rises. The new [[Seat of the European Central Bank]] in the [[Ostend (Frankfurt am Main)|Ostend]] district, consisting of the former wholesale market hall (''[[Großmarkthalle]]'') and a newly built 185-meter skyscraper, was completed in late 2014. The new building complex was designed to accommodate up to 2,300 ECB personnel. The location is a few kilometers away from downtown and borders an industrial area as well as the Osthafen (''East Harbor''), It was primarily chosen because of its large premises which allows the ECB to install security arrangements without high fences.

The city honors the importance of the ECB by officially using the slogan "The City of the Euro" since 1998.

====Deutsche Bundesbank====
The {{lang|de|[[Deutsche Bundesbank]]|italic=no}} (German Federal Bank), located in [[Bockenheim (Frankfurt am Main)|Ginnheim]], was established in 1957 as the central bank for the Federal Republic of Germany. Until the euro (€) was introduced in 1999, the Deutsche Bundesbank was responsible for the monetary policy of Germany and for the German currency, the [[Deutsche Mark]] (DM). The Bundesbank was greatly respected for its control of inflation through the second half of the 20th century. Today the Bundesbank is an integral part of the [[European System of Central Banks]] (ESCB) which is formed by all 27 EU member states. Its bilance sheet total is around 2,7 trillion,<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.bundesbank.de/de/bundesbank/organisation/die-bundesbank-in-zahlen/die-bundesbank-in-zahlen-604102 | title=Die Bundesbank in Zahlen | access-date=18 July 2024 | archive-date=18 July 2024 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240718044854/https://www.bundesbank.de/de/bundesbank/organisation/die-bundesbank-in-zahlen/die-bundesbank-in-zahlen-604102 | url-status=live }}</ref> making it the 4th biggest central bank.

{{main|Frankfurt Stock Exchange}}
[[File:Bulle und Bär Frankfurt.jpg|thumb|[[Market trend|Bull and bear]] in front of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange]]
The Frankfurt Stock Exchange (''Frankfurter Wertpapierbörse'') began in the ninth century. By the 16th century Frankfurt had developed into an important European hub for trade fairs and financial services. Today the Frankfurt Stock Exchange is by far the largest in Germany, with a turnover of more than 90 percent of the German [[stock market]] and is the third-largest in Europe after the [[London Stock Exchange|London]] and the [[Euronext Paris|Paris]]. The most important [[stock market index]] is the [[DAX]], the index of the 30 largest German business companies listed at the stock exchange. The stock exchange is owned and operated by {{Lang|de|[[Deutsche Börse]]|italic=no}}, which is itself listed in the DAX. Deutsche Börse also owns the European [[futures exchange]] [[Eurex]] and clearing company [[Clearstream]]. 
On 1 February 2012 European Commission blocked the proposed merger of Deutsche Börse and [[New York Stock Exchange|NYSE Euronext]]. "The merger between Deutsche Börse and NYSE Euronext would have led to a near-monopoly in European financial derivatives worldwide. These markets are at the heart of the financial system and it is crucial for the whole European economy that they remain competitive. We tried to find a solution, but the remedies offered fell far short of resolving the concerns."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-12-94_en.htm |website=europa.eu |title=Mergers: Commission blocks proposed merger between Deutsche Börse and NYSE Euronext, European Commission – Press release |access-date=19 February 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170220020112/http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-12-94_en.htm |archive-date=20 February 2017 |url-status=live}}</ref> European competition commissioner [[Joaquín Almunia]] said.

In 1337 the [[Louis IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Holy Roman Emperor Louis IV of Bavaria]] issued a diploma privilege so that any other city was not allowed to establish a market or trade fair if this could harm the Frankfurt Trade Fair in any way. This imperial backing allowed Frankfurt to retain the commanding importance of the Frankfurt Trade Fair for centuries. In the Middle Ages the full range of manufactured and semi-processed commodities were trade at Frankfurt Fairs.<ref>{{cite book|title=Textiles and the Medieval Economy: Production, Trade, and Consumption of Textiles, 8th–16th Centuries|editor1=Angela Ling Huang|editor2=Carsten Jahnke|publisher=Oxbow Books|isbn=9781782976509|date=2014|page=217}}</ref>

===Landmarks===
====Römer====
[[File:Frankfurter Römer.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|[[Römer]], the city hall]]
[[Römer]], the German word for [[Rome|Roman]], is a complex of nine houses that form the Frankfurt [[city hall]] (''Rathaus''). The houses were acquired by the city council in 1405 from a wealthy merchant family. The middle house became the city hall and was later connected with its neighbors. The ''Kaisersaal'' ("Emperor's Hall") is located on the upper floor and is where the newly crowned emperors held their banquets. The Römer was partially destroyed in World War II and later rebuilt. The surrounding square, the Römerberg, is named after the city hall.

Frankfurt is one of two sites of the [[German National Library]] (''Deutsche Nationalbibliothek''), the other being [[Leipzig]]. The Deutsche Nationalbibliothek is a [[universal library]] in Germany. Its task, unique in Germany, is to collect, permanently archive, comprehensively document and record bibliographically all German and German-language publications from 1913 on, foreign publications about Germany, translations of German works and the works of German-speaking emigrants published abroad between 1933 and 1945, and to make them available to the public.<ref>{{Cite web |title=§ 2 DNBG – Einzelnorm |url=http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/dnbg/__2.html |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210321140624/http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/dnbg/__2.html |archive-date=21 March 2021 |access-date=25 May 2021 |website=www.gesetze-im-internet.de}}</ref>

==== Frankfurt Cathedral ====

[[Frankfurt Cathedral]] ({{lang|de|Frankfurter Dom}}) is not a cathedral, but the main Catholic church, dedicated to [[Bartholomew the Apostle|St. Bartholomew]]. The [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] building was constructed in the 14th and 15th centuries on the foundation of an earlier church from the [[Merovingian]] time. From 1356 onwards, kings of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] were elected in this church, and from 1562 to 1792, [[Holy Roman Empire|Roman-German]] emperors were crowned there.

Since the 18th century, St. Bartholomew's has been called {{lang|de|Dom}}, although it was never a bishop's seat. In 1867 it was destroyed by fire and rebuilt in its present style. It was again partially destroyed in [[World War II]] and rebuilt in the 1950s. Its height is {{Convert|95|m|abbr=on}}. The cathedral tower has a viewing platform open to the public at a height of {{Convert|66|m|abbr=on}}, accessed through a narrow spiral staircase with 386 steps.

====St. Paul's Church====

[[St. Paul's Church, Frankfurt|St. Paul's Church]] is a national historic monument in Germany because it was the seat of the first democratically elected parliament in 1848. It was established in 1789 as a [[Protestant]] church, but was not completed until 1833. Its importance has its roots in the [[Frankfurt Parliament]], which met in the church during the revolutionary years of 1848/49 in order to write a constitution for a united Germany. The attempt failed because the monarchs of [[Prussia]] and Austria did not want to lose power. In 1849, Prussian troops ended the democratic experiment by force and the parliament dissolved; the building was once more used for religious services.

St. Paul's was partially destroyed in World War II with its interior significantly damaged. It was quickly and symbolically rebuilt after the war albeit with modern alterations particularly to the interior; today it is used mainly for exhibitions and events.

====Archäologischer Garten Frankfurt====

The Archaeological Garden contains small parts of the oldest recovered buildings: an ancient Roman settlement and the Frankfurt Royal Palace (''Kaiserpfalz Frankfurt'') from the sixth century. The garden is located between the Römerberg and the cathedral. It was discovered after World War II when the area was heavily bombed and later partly rebuilt. The remains were preserved and are now open to the public. From 2013 until 2015 an event building, the Stadthaus ("City house"), has been built on top of the garden, but it remains open to the public free of charge.

====Haus Wertheim====

Wertheim House is the only [[Timber framing|timbered house]] in the [[Altstadt (Frankfurt am Main)|Altstadt]] district that survived the heavy bombings of World War II undamaged. It is located on the Römerberg next to the Historical Museum.

====Saalhof====

The [[Saalhof]] is the oldest conserved building in the [[Altstadt (Frankfurt am Main)|Altstadt]] district and dates to the 12th century. It was used as an exhibition hall by Dutch [[cloth merchant|clothiers]] when trade fairs were held during the 14th and 15th centuries. The Saalhof was partly destroyed in World War II and later rebuilt. Today it serves as a part of the [[Historical museum, Frankfurt|Historical Museum]].

====Eiserner Steg====

The Eiserner Steg (Iron Bridge) is a pedestrian-only bridge across the Main that connects Römerberg and Sachsenhausen. It was built in 1868 and was the second bridge to cross the river. After World War II, when it was blown up by the [[Wehrmacht]], it was quickly rebuilt in 1946. Today some 10,000 people cross the bridge on a daily basis.

====Alte Oper====
[[File:Alte Oper Frankfurt Winter 2008.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|[[Alte Oper]], now a concert hall, at Opernplatz]]
The [[Alte Oper]] is a former [[opera house]], hence the name "Old Opera". The opera house was built in 1880 by architect Richard Lucae. It was one of the major opera houses in Germany until it was heavily damaged in World War II. Until the late 1970s, it was a ruin, nicknamed "Germany's most beautiful ruin". Former Frankfurt [[Lord Mayor]] Rudi Arndt called for blowing it up in the 1960s, which earned him the nickname "Dynamite-Rudi". (Later on, Arndt said he never had meant his suggestion seriously.)

Public pressure led to its refurbishment and reopening in 1981. Today, it functions as a famous concert hall, while operas are performed at the "new" Frankfurt Opera. The inscription on the [[frieze]] of the Alte Oper says: "''Dem Wahren, Schönen, Guten''" ("To the true, the beautiful, the good").

====Eschenheimer Turm====

The Eschenheim Tower (''[[Eschenheimer Turm]]'') was erected at the beginning of the 15th century and served as a city gate as part of late-medieval fortifications. It is the oldest and most unaltered building in the [[Innenstadt (Frankfurt am Main)|Innenstadt]] district.

====St. Catherine's Church====

[[St. Catherine's Church, Frankfurt|St. Catherine's Church]] is the largest [[Protestant Church in Germany|Protestant]] church, dedicated to [[Catherine of Alexandria]], a [[martyr]]ed early Christian saint. It is located downtown at the entrance to the Zeil, the central pedestrian shopping street.

====Hauptwache====

Although today [[Hauptwache (Frankfurt am Main)|Hauptwache]] is mostly associated with the inner-city underground train station [[Frankfurt (Main) Hauptwache station|of the same name]], the name originates from a [[Baroque architecture|baroque]] building on the square above the station. The Hauptwache building was constructed in 1730 and was used as a prison, therefore the name that translates as "main guard-house". Today the square surrounding the building is also called "Hauptwache" (formal: {{lang|de|An der Hauptwache}}). It is situated downtown opposite to St. Catherine's Church.

====Central Station====

[[Frankfurt Central Station]] (''Frankfurt Hauptbahnhof''), which opened in 1888, was built as the central train station for Frankfurt to replace three smaller downtown train stations and to boost the needed capacity for travellers. It was constructed as a [[Terminal station|terminus station]] and was the largest train station in Europe by floor area until 1915 when [[Leipzig Hauptbahnhof|Leipzig Central Station]] was opened. Its three main halls were constructed in a [[Renaissance Revival architecture|neorenaissance]]-style, while the later enlargement with two outer halls in 1924 was constructed in [[neoclassicism|neoclassic]]-style.

====Frankfurter Hof====

The Frankfurter Hof is a landmark downtown hotel at Kaiserplatz, built from 1872 to 1876. It is part of [[Steigenberger Hotels]] group and is considered the city's most prestigious.

====St. Leonhard====

[[St. Leonhard, Frankfurt|St. Leonhard]], on the Main close to the bridge Eiserner Steg, is a Catholic [[Gothic architecture|late Gothic]] [[hall church]], derived from a [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque style]] [[basilica]] beginning in 1425. It is the only one of nine churches in the Old Town that survived World War II almost undamaged. The parish serves the English-speaking community. The church has been under restoration from 2011 until 2019.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.fr.de/frankfurt/frankfurt-leonhardskirche-oeffnet-nach-sanierung-wieder-11765613.html |title=Gläubige dürfen zurück in uralte Leonhardskirche in Frankfurt |date=15 February 2019 |access-date=14 December 2020 |archive-date=27 April 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210427223541/https://www.fr.de/frankfurt/frankfurt-leonhardskirche-oeffnet-nach-sanierung-wieder-11765613.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Skyscrapers===
{{See also|List of tallest buildings in Frankfurt}}
{{wide image|Frankfurt am Main Skyline (51395421615).jpg|800px|View of Frankfurt from the [[Taunus]]}}

Frankfurt is unique among German cities with regards to [[skyscraper]]s. Since the 1970s some of the tallest buildings in Germany have been built along the Mainzer Landstrasse. The [[Main Tower]] was completed in 1999 with its top floor skydeck and penthouse restaurant designed to be open to tourists.<ref>{{cite book |editor1=Georges Binder |title=Tall Buildings of Europe, Middle East and Africa |year=2006 |publisher= Images |isbn=9781876907815 |page=14}}</ref> Frankfurt hosts 20 out of Germany's 21 [[List of tallest buildings in Germany|skyscrapers]]. Most skyscrapers and high-rise office buildings are located in the financial district ([[Bankenviertel]]), around the trade fair premises ([[Europaviertel (Frankfurt)|Europaviertel]]) and at [[Mainzer Landstraße]] between Opernplatz and Platz der Republik, which connects the two areas.

The 20 skyscrapers are:

===History of high-rise buildings===
{{see also|List of tallest buildings in Frankfurt}}
[[File:Skyline-sued-ffm002 henninger turm.jpg|thumb|right|The original Henninger Turm in 2007]]
[[File:Frankfurt Skyline (16259801511).jpg|thumb|upright=1.00|Skyline at dusk, seen from Deutschherrnbrücke (2014)]]
[[File:River Main Frankfurt.jpg|thumb|alt=Frankfurt Skyline at River Main|Bridges over River Main in Frankfurt 2023]]
For centuries, [[Frankfurt Cathedral|St. Bartholomeus's Cathedral]] was the tallest structure. The first building to exceed the 95-meter-high cathedral was not an office building but a [[grain silo]] {{cvt|120|m|ft|adj=mid|-high}} high.{{citation needed||date=March 2025}} The [[Henninger Turm]] was opened in the 1960s and the silo was topped by a [[revolving restaurant]] designed to be a landmark. The Henninger Turm was extensively refurbished and is now a residential high-rise.<ref>{{Cite web |publisher=Meixner Schlueter Wendt |title=Henninger Turm Frankfurt am Main |url=https://www.meixner-schlueter-wendt.de/en/projects/henninger-turm/ |date=2018}}</ref>

The first high-rise building boom came in the 1970s when [[Westend Gate]] (then called ''Plaza Büro Center'') and [[Silberturm]] were constructed and became the tallest buildings in Germany with a height of 159.3 meters and 166.3 meters, respectively. Around the same time, [[Frankfurter Büro Center]] and [[City-Haus]] (142.4 meters and 142.1 meters) were constructed at Mainzer Landstraße and [[Eurotower (Frankfurt)|Eurotower]] (148.0 meters) and [[Garden Tower]] (127.0 meters; then called ''Helaba-Hochhaus'') were constructed in the financial district.

None of the buildings constructed during the 1980s surpassed Silberturm. The most famous buildings from this decade are the [[Deutsche Bank Twin Towers]] at Taunusanlage, both 155.0 meters tall.

The 1990s featured a second wave. [[Messeturm]], built on the trade fair site, reached a height of {{convert|256.5|m|sp=us}} and became the tallest building in Europe by 1991. It was overtaken by the {{cvt|259|m|ft|adj=mid|-high|sp=us}} [[Commerzbank Tower]] in 1997. Other tall buildings from this decade are [[Westendstrasse 1]] ({{convert|208|m|sp=us}}), [[Main Tower]] ({{convert|200|m|sp=us}}) and [[Trianon (Frankfurt am Main)|Trianon]] ({{convert|186|m|sp=us}}).

In 21st-century Frankfurt, more high-rise buildings and skyscrapers (e.g., [[Skyper]], [[Opernturm]], [[Tower 185]], [[Seat of the European Central Bank]], [[Taunusturm]]) emerged, but none have surpassed Commerzbank Tower.

===Other tall structures===
[[File:Europaturm Abend.jpg|thumb|right|Top of the [[Europaturm]], a {{cvt|337|m|ft}} communications tower]]
*[[Europaturm]] — The Europe Tower is a [[Radio masts and towers|telecommunications tower]], also known as the Frankfurt TV Tower, built from 1974 to 1979. With a height of 337.5 meters it is the tallest tower and the second tallest structure in Germany after the [[Fernsehturm Berlin]]. It was open to the public until 1999, with an entertainment establishment in the revolving top. It is normally referred to by locals as the "Ginnheimer Spargel" (''Ginnheim Asparagus''), but stands a few meters within [[Bockenheim (Frankfurt am Main)|Bockenheim]] district.
*[[Henninger Turm]] — The Henninger Tower was a 120-mete-high [[grain silo]] built from 1959 to 1961 and owned by [[Henninger Brewery]]. It was the highest structure until 1974. The Henninger Tower had two rotating restaurants at the height of 101 and 106 meters and an open-air observation deck at the height of 110 meters. The tower closed to the public in October 2002 and was demolished in 2013 to be replaced by a 140&nbsp;m (459&nbsp;ft) tall residential tower, which is externally inspired by the old Henninger Turm. The cornerstone for this project was laid in June 2014 and construction was completed in summer 2017. The new tower offers 207 luxury flats<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.baunetz.de/meldungen/Meldungen-Baubeginn_fuer_Henninger-Turm_in_Frankfurt_3947903.html |title=Transformation des Bestands – Baubeginn für Henninger-Turm in Frankfurt |date=27 June 2014 |access-date=14 December 2020 |archive-date=17 April 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210417234649/https://www.baunetz.de/meldungen/Meldungen-Baubeginn_fuer_Henninger-Turm_in_Frankfurt_3947903.html |url-status=live }}</ref> and houses the non-rotating restaurant "Franziska". From 1962 to 2008 a famous yearly [[Road bicycle racing|cycling race]] was named after the tower, the "Radrennen Rund um den Henninger Turm" (''Cycling race around Henninger Tower''). The now-renamed race is still a yearly event.
*[[Goethe Tower|Goetheturm]] – The Goethe Tower was a {{cvt|43|m|ft|adj=mid|-high}} tower on the northern edge of the [[Frankfurt City Forest]] in [[Sachsenhausen (Frankfurt am Main)|Sachsenhausen]]. It was the fifth tallest wood construction structure in Germany. It was built in 1931 and was a popular place for day-trippers until it burned down in 2017. A faithful reconstruction has been opened to the public on 12 October 2020, exactly three years after the original's destruction.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.hessenschau.de/panorama/der-neue-goetheturm-wird-ganz-wie-der-alte,goetheturm-wiederaufbau-100.html |title=Der neue Goetheturm wird ganz wie der alte |date=3 November 2017 |publisher=Hessenschau |access-date=17 November 2017 |language=de |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171118195740/http://www.hessenschau.de/panorama/der-neue-goetheturm-wird-ganz-wie-der-alte,goetheturm-wiederaufbau-100.html |archive-date=18 November 2017 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

===Shopping streets===
[[File:Frankfurt Am Main-Zeil-Ansicht vom Maintower am fruehen Abend-20110328.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Zeil]], Frankfurt's central shopping street]]
*[[Zeil]] – Frankfurt's central shopping street is a mile long and has been a shopping destination for more than a century. Only the western half of Zeil is pedestrianized. [[MyZeil]] is a stereotypical shopping mall.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/insider-guide-frankfurt/index.html |author=Joe Yogerst |title=Visiting Frankfurt? Insiders share tips |publisher=CNN Travel|date=25 March 2017}}</ref> Three more shopping malls occupy the Zeil: UpperZeil (replacing the [[Zeilgalerie]], which was demolished in 2016), [[Metro AG|Galeria Kaufhof]] and [[Arcandor|Karstadt]], as well as large fashion retail clothing stores from [[Peek & Cloppenburg]] and [[C&A]]. During the month before Christmas, the extended pedestrian-only zone is host to [[Frankfurt Christmas Market]], one of the largest and oldest Christmas markets in Germany. Zeil is bordered by two large public squares, [[Hauptwache (Frankfurt am Main)|Hauptwache]] in the west and [[Konstablerwache]] in the east. It is the second most expensive street for shops to rent in Germany after the [[Kaufingerstraße]] in Munich. 85 percent of the shops are retail chains such as [[H&M]], [[Saturn (store)|Saturn]], [[Esprit Holdings|Esprit]], [[Zara (retailer)|Zara]] or [[NewYorker]]. 
*[[Goethestraße]] – Frankfurt's shopping destination for prestigious luxury shops like [[Louis Vuitton]], [[Prada]], [[Gucci]], [[Tiffany & Co.|Tiffany]], [[Giorgio Armani]], [[Versace]], [[Cartier SA|Cartier]], [[Burberry]], [[Vertu]] and [[Bulgari]].
*[[Freßgass]] – (officially ''Kalbächer Gasse'' and ''Große Bockenheimer Straße'') is a central pedestrian-only street section between Börsenstraße and Opernplatz. The name translates as "feeding alley" because of its high concentration of gastronomy, but lately prestigious shops (e.g., [[Apple Store]], [[Hugo Boss]], [[Porsche Design Group|Porsche Design]]) have moved here due to the lack of space in the neighboring [[Goethestraße]], displacing old, established restaurants, butchers and delicatessens.
*Berger Straße – Frankfurt's longest shopping street. It starts in the city center, runs through [[Nordend, Frankfurt|Nordend]] and [[Bornheim (Frankfurt)|Bornheim]] and ends in [[Seckbach (Frankfurt am Main)|Seckbach]]. The street is less crowded than the Zeil and offers a greater variety of smaller shops, restaurants and cafés.
*Leipziger Straße – Central shopping street in the Bockenheim district starting at Bockenheimer Warte going towards West. High density of shops for daily needs. 
*Braubachstraße – In the [[Altstadt (Frankfurt am Main)|Altstadt]] district, close to the historic sites of the city, offers a large variety of art galleries, second-hand bookshops and antique shops.
*Münchener Straße – In the [[Bahnhofsviertel (Frankfurt am Main)|Bahnhofsviertel]] district, located between the central station and Willy-Brandt-Platz, is the most multicultural shopping street with many shops selling imported products mainly from Turkey, the Middle East and Asia.
*Kleinmarkthalle – (literally: ''Small Market Hall'') is a market hall close to Konstablerwache square offering fresh food and flowers. In addition to regional delicacies like [[green sauce]] imported goods are offered. The Kleinmarkthalle is the largest public marketplace in Frankfurt.

===Green city===
[[File:FFM_Jacobiweiher_Uferblick_von_NO_1.jpg|thumb|[[Frankfurt City Forest]]]]
With a large forest, many parks, the Main riverbanks and the two botanical gardens, Frankfurt is considered a "green city": More than 50 percent of the area within the city limits are protected green areas.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://frankfurt.de/greencity/ |title=Auf dem Weg zur Green City |publisher=Frankfurt.de |access-date=4 March 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180927124027/https://www.frankfurt.de/sixcms/detail.php?id=2855&_ffmpar%255B_id_inhalt%255D=7187755 |archive-date=27 September 2018 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

*Frankfurter Grüngürtel – The Green Belt is a ring-shaped public green space around the city. With 8,000 [[Hectare|ha]] it covers a third of the administrative area. It includes the Frankfurter Stadtwald (''[[Frankfurt City Forest]]'', Germany's largest forest within a city), the Schwanheimer Düne (''[[Schwanheim (Frankfurt am Main)|Schwanheim]] [[Dune]]''), the Niddatal (''[[Nidda (river)|Nidda]] [[Valley]]''), the Niddapark, the Lohrberg (''Lohr Mountain'', Frankfurt's only [[vineyard]]), the Huthpark, the Enkheimer Ried (''[[Frankfurt-Bergen-Enkheim|Enkheim]] [[Marsh]]''), the Seckbacher Ried (''[[Seckbach (Frankfurt am Main)|Seckbach]] [[Marsh]]'') and the Fechenheimer Mainbogen (a S-shaped part of the [[Main (river)|Main]] river in [[Fechenheim (Frankfurt am Main)|Fechenheim]]). The Green Belt is a [[protected area]] which means that housing is not allowed. The Green Belt was formally created in 1991 with its own constitution.
*Mainuferpark – The Mainuferpark (''Main Riverbanks Park'') is the common term to describe the inner-city Main riverbanks. It is an auto-free zone with large green areas that is popular with strollers and tourists, especially in the summertime, when it can become crowded. The southern riverbank, which continues further to [[Offenbach am Main]] and [[Hanau]], offers the best skyline views. The northern riverbank ends in the west at the former Westhafen (''West Harbor'', a residential housing area) and is growing to the east: A former industrial-used area between the new [[Seat of the European Central Bank]] and the Osthafen (''East Harbor'') has become a park named Hafenpark (''Harbor Park''), which offers outdoor courts for basketball, soccer and a skatepark.
*Wallanlagen – The [[Wallanlagen]] (former ''[[Defensive wall|ramparts]]'') relate to the former ring-shaped [[Defensive wall|city wall fortifications]] around the [[Altstadt (Frankfurt am Main)|Altstadt]] and the [[Innenstadt (Frankfurt am Main)|Innenstadt]] district (abolished 1804–1812), now a series of parks. Building is not allowed, with a few exceptions, the most famous being the [[Alte Oper]] (built 1880) at the Opernplatz. The part between the northern Main riverbank and the Opernplatz, referred to officially as Taunusanlage and Gallusanlage, is locally known as "Central Park" (a reference to the [[Central Park|famous park]] in [[Manhattan]]), because of the skyscrapers which stand on both sides.
*Nizza Park – At the juncture of the northern Main riverbank and the Wallanlagen is a famous small park called Nizza. The name of the park recalls [[Nice]] in southern France, because it is one of the warmest areas with a nearly [[mediterranean climate]]. Numerous [[Mediterranean flora]] grow there and can survive outside during the winter.
*Garten des Himmlischen Friedens – "Garden of Heavenly Peace", named after the [[Tiananmen Square|Tiananmen Gate]] in Beijing, is a Chinese-styled park in the [[Nordend (Frankfurt am Main)|Nordend]] district and part of the larger Bethmannpark. It contains Chinese buildings, with building materials imported from China and built by Chinese workers in the 1980s. Hosts traditional Chinese plants and herbs.
*Other parks – The largest parks are the Niddapark (168 ha), the Ostpark (32 ha) and the [[Grüneburgpark]] (29 ha).

===Performing arts===
====Music====
[[Eurodance]] and [[Trance music]] originated in Frankfurt.

Snap! songs combined [[Hip hop music|Rap]] and [[Soul music|Soul]] vocals adding rhythm by using computer technology and mixing electronic sounds, bass and drums. By doing so a new genre was born: Eurodance.<ref>{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Neue Ehrlichkeit.

The A5 in the west, the A3 in the south and the A661 in the northeast form a [[ring road]] around the inner city districts and define a [[Low-emission zone]] (''Umweltzone''; established in 2008), meaning that vehicles have to meet certain emission criteria to enter the zone.

The streets of central Frankfurt are usually congested with cars during [[rush hour]]. Some areas, especially around the shopping streets Zeil, Goethestraße and Freßgass, are pedestrian-only streets.

===Railway stations===
====Frankfurt Central Station====
[[File:Hauptbahnhof Frankfurt.jpg|thumb|left|[[Frankfurt (Main) Hauptbahnhof|Frankfurt Central Station]]]]
[[File:Frankfurt Hauptbahnhof tief S-Bahn S6.jpg|thumb|left|[[S-Bahn]] at [[Frankfurt Central Station (underground station)|Central Station (underground)]]]]
Frankfurt Hauptbahnhof ''(''often abbreviated as ''Frankfurt (Main) Hbf'' or ''F-Hbf'') is the largest railway station in Germany by railway traffic. By daily passenger volume, it ranks second (493,000 each) after [[Hamburg Hauptbahnhof|Hamburg Central Station]] (550,000). It is located between the [[Gallus (Frankfurt am Main)|Gallus]], the [[Gutleutviertel]] and the [[Bahnhofsviertel (Frankfurt am Main)|Bahnhofsviertel]] district, not far away from the trade fair and the financial district. It serves as a major hub for long-distance trains ([[InterCity]], [[InterCityExpress|ICE]]) and regional trains as well as for Frankfurt's public transport system. It is a stop for most of ICE high-speed lines, making it Germany's most important ICE station. ICE Trains to London via the [[Channel Tunnel]] were planned for 2013.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/travel/travel-news/highspeed-trains-to-link-england-and-germany-20111013-1lmq8.html |title=High-speed trains to link England and Germany |publisher=Brisbanetimes.com.au |date=16 October 2011 |access-date=16 May 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120621035917/http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/travel/travel-news/highspeed-trains-to-link-england-and-germany-20111013-1lmq8.html |archive-date=21 June 2012 |url-status=live}}</ref> All [[Rhine-Main S-Bahn]] lines, two [[Frankfurt U-Bahn|U-Bahn]] lines (U4, U5), several tram and bus lines stop there.

====Frankfurt Airport stations====
[[File:DSCI0058 Flughafen Frankfurt Squaire.jpg|thumb|[[ICE 3]] departing westward from [[Frankfurt Airport long-distance station]] underneath [[The Squaire]]]]
Frankfurt Airport can be accessed by two railway stations: [[Frankfurt Airport long-distance station]] (''Frankfurt Flughafen Fernbahnhof'') is only for long-distance traffic and connects the airport to the main rail network, with most of the [[InterCityExpress|ICE]] services using the [[Cologne-Frankfurt high-speed rail line]]. The long-distance station is located outside the actual airport ground but has a connecting bridge for pedestrians to Terminal 1, concourse B. [[Frankfurt Airport regional station]] (''Frankfurt Flughafen Regionalbahnhof'') is for local [[Rhine-Main S-Bahn|S-Bahn]] trains (lines S8, S9) and regional trains. The regional station is located within Terminal 1, concourse B.

====Frankfurt South station====
Frankfurt's third long-distance station is [[Frankfurt South station]] (''Frankfurt Südbahnhof'', often abbreviated as ''Frankfurt (Main) Süd'' or ''F-Süd''), located in [[Sachsenhausen (Frankfurt am Main)|Sachsenhausen]]. It is an important destination for local trains and trams (lines 15, 16 and 18) and the terminal stop for four U-Bahn lines (U1, U2, U3, U8) as well as three S-Bahn lines (S3, S4, S5). Line S6 also serves the station.

====Messe stations====
The [[Frankfurt Trade Fair]] offers two railway stations: [[Frankfurt Messe station|Messe station]] is for local [[Rhine-Main S-Bahn|S-Bahn]] trains (lines S3-S6) and is centrally located amid trade fair premises, while Festhalle/Messe station is served by U-Bahn line U4 and is located at the north-east corner of the premises.

====Konstablerwache station and Hauptwache station====
Two other major downtown railway stations are Konstablerwache and Hauptwache, located on each end of the Zeil. They are the main stations to change from east-to-west-bound S-Bahn trains to north-to-south-bound U-Bahn trains. Konstablerwache station is the second-busiest railway station regarding daily passenger volume (98,000) after the central station. The third-busiest railway station is Hauptwache station (93,000).<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.howtogermany.com/pages/frankfurt.html |title=How to Germany – Frankfurt am Main: The Gateway to Germany |access-date=6 October 2020 |archive-date=26 September 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200926095555/https://www.howtogermany.com/pages/frankfurt.html |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://addr.ws/frankfurt-konstablerwache-station-train-station--frankfurt-de.html |title=Frankfurt Konstablerwache station |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200128114229/https://addr.ws/frankfurt-konstablerwache-station-train-station--frankfurt-de.html |archive-date=28 January 2020}}</ref>

===Coach stations===
There are three stations for [[intercity bus service]]s in Frankfurt: one at the south side of the Central Station, one at the Terminal 2 of the airport and another one at Stephanstraße.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.travelinho.com/en/travel/frankfurt |title=Frankfurt: Stations |publisher=Travelinho.com |access-date=21 November 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201044654/http://www.travelinho.com/en/travel/frankfurt |archive-date=1 December 2017 |url-status=live}}</ref>

===Public transport===
{{Main|Public transport in Frankfurt am Main}}
[[File:Frankfurt am Main - Netzplan Schienennahverkehr.png|thumb|Public transport network]]
The city has two [[rapid transit]] systems: the U-Bahn and the S-Bahn, as well as an above-ground tram system. Information about the U- and S-Bahn can be found on the website of the [[Rhein-Main-Verkehrsverbund|RMV]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rmv.de/coremedia/generator/RMV/Sprachen/SPRACH__ART__en.html |title=Rhein-Main Transport Association |publisher=RMV.DE |date=24 November 2010 |access-date=10 April 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100727002756/http://www.rmv.de/coremedia/generator/RMV/Sprachen/SPRACH__ART__en.html |archive-date=27 July 2010}}</ref>

====S-Bahn====
{{main|Rhine-Main S-Bahn}}
Nine [[S-Bahn]] lines (S1 to S9) connect Frankfurt with the densely populated [[Frankfurt Rhein-Main Region|Rhine Main Region]]. Most routes have at least 15-minute service during the day, either by one line running every 15 minutes, or by two lines servicing one route at a 30-minute interval. All lines, except line S7, run through the [[Frankfurt City Tunnel]] and serve stations at [[Frankfurt Ostendstraße station|Ostendstraße]], [[Frankfurt (Main) Konstablerwache station|Konstablerwache]], [[Frankfurt (Main) Hauptwache station|Hauptwache]], [[Taunusanlage station|Taunusanlage]] and [[Frankfurt Central Station]]. When leaving the city the S-Bahn travels above ground. It provides access to the trade fair (S3, S4, S5, S6), the airport (S8, S9), the stadium (S7, S8, S9) and nearby cities such as [[Wiesbaden]], [[Mainz]], [[Darmstadt]], [[Rüsselsheim]], [[Hanau]], [[Offenbach am Main]], [[Oberursel]], [[Bad Homburg]], [[Kronberg]], [[Friedberg, Hesse|Friedberg]] and smaller towns that are on the way. The S8/S9 runs 24/7.

====U-Bahn====
[[File:DSC03475 B44 Ludwig-Landmann-Straße.jpg|thumb|Underground line ''U7'' running as a ''[[Stadtbahn]]'' amidst [[Ludwig Landmann|Ludwig-Landmann]]-Straße in [[Rödelheim|Frankfurt-Rödelheim]]]]
{{main|Frankfurt U-Bahn}}
The [[U-Bahn]] has nine lines (U1 to U9) serving Frankfurt and the larger suburbs of Bad Homburg and Oberursel in the north. The trains that run on the U-Bahn are in fact [[light rail]] (''[[Stadtbahn]]'') as many lines travel along a track in the middle of the street instead of underground. The minimum service interval is 2.5 minutes, although the usual pattern is that each line runs at 7.5- to 10-minute intervals, which produce between 3- and 5-minute intervals on downtown tracks shared by more than one line.

====Tram====
{{main|Trams in Frankfurt am Main}}
Frankfurt has ten tram lines (11, 12, 14 to 21), with trams arriving usually every 10 minutes. Many sections are served by two lines, combining to run at 5-minute intervals during rush-hour. Trams only run above ground and serve more stops than the U-Bahn or the S-Bahn.

====Bus====
{{main|Public transport in Frankfurt am Main#Bus}}
A number of bus lines complete the Frankfurt public transport system. Night buses replace U-Bahn and tram services between 1:30&nbsp;am and 3:30&nbsp;am.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nachtbus-frankfurt.de |title=Nightbus Frankfurt Rheinmain |publisher=Nachtbus-frankfurt.de |access-date=10 April 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110430194211/http://www.nachtbus-frankfurt.de/ |archive-date=30 April 2011 |url-status=dead}}</ref> The central junction for the night bus service is at the downtown square of Konstablerwache, where all night bus lines start and end.

===Taxis===
[[Taxicab]]s can usually be found outside the major S-Bahn and U-Bahn stations, at the central station, the south station, the airport, the trade fair and in the crowded inner-city shopping streets. The common way to obtain a taxi is to either call a taxi operator or to go to a taxi rank. However, although not the norm, one can hail a passing taxi on the street.

[[Uber]] ceased operations in Frankfurt on 9 November 2015 after operating in the city for 18 months.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Uber Pulls Out of Three German Cities After Court Ban Shrinks Driver Pool |url=https://techcrunch.com/2015/11/02/uber-retrenches-in-germany/ |first=Natasha |last=Lomas |work=[[TechCrunch]] |date=2 November 2015 |access-date=25 June 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170528205741/https://techcrunch.com/2015/11/02/uber-retrenches-in-germany/ |archive-date=28 May 2017 |url-status=live}}</ref> However, [[UberX]] and local cabs are available through the Uber app.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Frankfurt: a guide for getting around in the city |url=https://www.uber.com/global/en/cities/frankfurt/ |access-date=6 December 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170528205741/https://www.uber.com/global/en/cities/frankfurt/ |archive-date=28 May 2017 |url-status=live}}</ref>

===Bicycles===
[[File:Frankfurt Velotaxi.jpg|thumb|Velotaxi at the Zeil]]
{{lang|de|[[Deutsche Bahn]]|italic=no}} makes bicycles available for hire through their [[Call a Bike]] service. The bicycles are stationed all over the city, including at selected railway stations. They can easily be spotted because of their eye-catching silver-red color. To rent a specific bike, riders either call a service number to get an unlock code or reserve the bike via the smartphone application. To return the bike, the rider locks it within a designated return area (and calls the service number, if not booked via the app).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.callabike-interaktiv.de/ |title=Call a Bike: Startseite |work=callabike-interaktiv.de |access-date=28 September 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110924030211/http://www.callabike-interaktiv.de/ |archive-date=24 September 2011 |url-status=live}}</ref>

[[Nextbike]] also makes bicycles available for hire in Frankfurt. They are stationed all over the city. These can be spotted with their blue color scheme.

[[Cycle rickshaw]]s (velotaxis), a type of [[tricycle]] designed to carry passengers in addition to the driver, are also available. These are allowed to operate in pedestrian-only areas and are therefore practical for sightseeing.

Frankfurt has a network of cycle routes. Many long-distance bike routes into the city have cycle tracks that are separate from motor vehicle traffic. A number of downtown roads are "bicycle streets" where the cyclist has the right of way and where motorized vehicles are only allowed access if they do not disrupt the cycle users. In addition, cyclists are allowed to ride many cramped one-way streets in both directions. {{As of|2015}}, 15 percent of citizens used bicycles.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Radfahrbüro der Stadt Frankfurt |url=http://www.radfahren-ffm.de/ |website=www.radfahren-ffm.de |access-date = 5 September 2015 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20091112051827/http://www.radfahren-ffm.de/ |archive-date = 12 November 2009 |url-status = live}}</ref>

===E-Scooters===
Since 15 June 2019, the use of [[e-scooters]] was officially permitted by the German federal government. In Frankfurt, companies like [[Lime (transportation company)|Lime]], TIER, [[Bird (transportation company)|Bird]], voi., [[Dott (transportation company)|Dott]] or [[Bolt (company)|Bolt]] are offering their electric micro mobility vehicles for lease. However, their use is being regarded with increasing weariness due to frequent abuse (parking, speeding, vandalism, accidents) and has sparked a public debate about the need of further regulation of the e-scooter market.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Frankfurt sagt E-Scooter-Rüpeln den Kampf an |url=https://www.fnp.de/frankfurt/frankfurt-sagt-scooter-ruepeln-den-kampf-an-91280428.html/ |date=3 February 2022 |access-date=6 December 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220203212742/https://www.fnp.de/frankfurt/frankfurt-sagt-scooter-ruepeln-den-kampf-an-91280428.html |archive-date=3 February 2022 |url-status=live}}</ref>
