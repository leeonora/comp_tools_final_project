New York City lies in the northeastern United States, in southeastern New York State, approximately halfway between Washington, D.C. and [[Boston]]. Its location at the mouth of the [[Hudson River]], which feeds into a naturally sheltered harbor and then into the Atlantic Ocean, has helped the city become a significant trading port. Most of the city is built on the three islands of Long Island, Manhattan, and Staten Island.

During the [[Wisconsin glaciation]], 75,000 to 11,000 years ago, the New York City area was situated at the edge of a large [[ice sheet]].<ref name="JacksonKeller2010a">{{cite book |first1=Kenneth T. |last1=Jackson |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lI5ERUmHf3YC&pg=PT2384 |title=The Encyclopedia of New York City: Second Edition |first2=Lisa |last2=Keller |first3=Nancy |last3=Flood |publisher=[[Yale University Press]] |year=2010 |isbn=978-0-300-18257-6 |page=2384 }}</ref> The erosive forward movement of the ice (and its subsequent retreat) contributed to the separation of what is now Long Island and Staten Island.
